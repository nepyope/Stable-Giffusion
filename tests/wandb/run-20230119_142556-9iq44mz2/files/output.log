(" is Jody with welding tips and tricks' calm we're going old-school TIG today I've got an old Lincoln tombstone AC buzz box and I've got two old do yourself rectifier that I hooked up to it and we're going to do scratch start TIG that's the old rectifier I traded for that years ago and it works it's really heavy-duty and stick around at the end of the video and we're going to run some really noisy beads on a block of Steel with this thing stick around a little bit later in the video I'll run several beads and we'll kind of check out and see what this little buzz box dry rig scratch start thing can do well that's the set up rectifier is set on top of an AC Lincoln tune stone welder got the stinger basically hooked into one cable that was already attached probably not the best way to have it all hooked up but just for the purposes of a quick demo on this machine I just clamped the things to the cables that were already attached and you can see right there some really heavy cables and diodes and whatnot attached to the big aluminum channel buses to kind of separate everything it's a heavy-duty unit at least 35 years old I traded for it over 20 years ago and I know there's a little bit of the story behind it so it's an old homemade rectifier but you gotta lay electrode negative coming out right here and that's the one that goes to the TIG torch speaking of the TIG torch I've got an old old TIG torch that I traded for over 30 years ago it's a CK and look at the name on that it's calmly and klepon I didn't even know that's what CK's stood for until I got this old torch out but that's an old heavy-duty air-cooled TIG torch from CK been around a while see the valve on there is to turn the gas off when you're done you need that if you're using a dry rig you can you can well without it but you'll waste a lot of gas cuz you'll forget to walk over to the flow meter and turn it off when you're done run a bead and speaking of the flow meter again I trade it for this thing over 30 years ago it's a heavy duty air co flow meter thing weighs about 10 pounds it's old its heavy-duty its rugged it'll probably be around a long time I've had it well over 30 years and I think it was pretty old when I traded for it so it's rugged but the argon hose from the TIG torch though to the flowmeter the cable goes to the welding machine and that's about it use a little different wrinkle in this because I've always found that scratch start TIG wasn't that big a deal to get started that wasn't the deal that was stopping you know when you got a whip out snap out that's when you that's when that's when it's hard to be delicate like I say lighting up is no problem but when you Traill out you got to speed up and then whip out and of course you lose argon shielding and you can have some little minimal defect that on pipe is very easy to file and brush but on stainless steel sheet food service equipment or something like that be very difficult to clean that up so being able to stop and maintaining shielding is a real big deal for a lot of things back in the day when I was doing a lot of pipe weld and I would have my fitter just hold the hold of stinger to the tab in his hands and when I get finished and get ready to whip out I just say okay and he pulled it apart and and I'd stop the weld and the benefit of that is I maintain gas shielding and wouldn't have to do all that filing and brushing so it's not good for everything is you still have to kind of trail out on a route pass to keep from leaving a crater fisheye whatever but it does have a lot of value like you could do a lot of stainless steel foodservice type stuffs sheet metal with a scratch start TIG and if you're able to stop and maintain shielding it makes a huge difference so I put together a little foot pedal it's just a switch it's not a amperage control it's just a simple switch made out of a knife switch like from an automotive application and so it's very crude a couple a couple of brackets here knife switch it's like a main shutoff switch for a vehicle or or some tractor or something like that so that the five-year-old can't go start it so here's what that looks like when you can stop the weld and maintain shielding make difference one of these poles here will be just were they coming out of the welding machine now this video is not about building a DC rectifier so just forget about that imagine this was just the negative output on any DC stick welder a Miller Thunderbolt or Lincoln DC welder any DC stick welder you the negative side for TIG welding steel would go to the tick torch in this case I've got it attached to one of the poles on the foot pedal and the other the other one is is going to the TIG torch which again is an old old CKD TIG torch and the other line is the argon line that runs into TIG torch just hooked up to the flow meter simple set up but still being used all over the place on construction sites and then the stinger will hook to the other one or I can hook directly to the will take torch to the to the other one so basically when I'm welding along here I've got the circuit is a running current through there and then when I want to stop I just banged my foot on the pedal knife switch opens and it stops the stops the weld maybe twenty-five bucks worth of stuff ordered this off knife switch off Amazon you know a little finagling a little making brackets and putting it together with a couple of pieces of board and it's a switch talking to a friend of mine just just today and he was talking about when he got out of welding school he went into the dairy work and doing doing two inch stainless skid 10 stainless for for food service and you know they said there's your welding machine he said where's the foot pedal and they said what foot pedal there's no foot pedal there's your welding machine Miller Thunderbolt hooked up to a TIG torch and a bottle of argon Stinger hooked onto a tab on the on the TIG torch that is very common in construction because it's it's rugged its durable and it says now it relies on the welders skill to compensate for foot pedal amperage control all that stuff but it is people who are doing people are diamond in Wells out there every day using a simple setup like that it's not the best setup it's just rugged also when you got it like this now your TIG torch laying around is not hot so that's kind of a good thing if you sit on it right so anyway hold on I'm getting a call hey baby doll how you doing hey can I get you back air gasps guys call me helium shortage you're right that is total BS I'm coming down there what up grandma okay back to reality here one of the things I'm going to do for I get started here is I'm going to swap out this big collet body cup what not it's a number eight cup it's kind of got crud on the inside of it this thing's been sitting in a gang box for years but I'm going to put on what's called a stubby gas lens also from CK so the first thing I've got to swap out the little Teflon insulator to one that allows the cup to seat on it I'll screw in the stubby gas lens and bang now all of a sudden I just shortened that whole TIG torch by a lot and it also is going to get a lot better gas coverage I'll put in the old 2% lanthanide electrode here's another tip for you on a scratch start rig like this you can actually start the arc by flicking the wire like that against the tip boom some guys actually actually flick it with one end and then flip it in their hand like a you know like the drummer from Def Leppard or something clips the drumstick around and then feed the other end so any contaminants are on the end that's not used there you go there's the first bead notice how noisy that was that is a noisy noisy arc on this thing that was one thing jumped out at me it's it's a fairly decent arc it's capable of doing some stuff but man so much more noisy than I'm used to with all the inverters that I've been doing for for a long time now I'll show you all compare it here in just a second when I get finished with this arc I left the noise kind of up so you can't tell the difference boom now here's an inverter this is at HTTP 221 unit the argon flow is actually louder than the arc not saying that's good or bad just is what it is come back here with a second bead stacking it you can notice I noticed a little bit of difference on this arc it seems to have quite a bit of force to it like almost it looks almost like I'm I've got a small cup with a lot of argon flow and it's pushing down in the puddle but that's not what it is I've got a normal argon flow but you see the depressions it's kind of making and I don't know what is going on there maybe it's just the you know the the have a waveform the the current is rougher now it's smooth as a as an inverter but it's different might actually be better for some application certainly you're showing here that that set up like this is capable of making a decent looking well or a decent quality weld and I'm not doing anything to write home about here on this block of Steel but I'm just trying to you know since that TIG torch has been in a box for 20 years I figured I might as well just run some beads rather than try to weld anything with it there's using the foot pedal maintaining that shielding on the end so and as we eat what it looks like stacking a bunch of beads so you know some success all right coming very soon in a video I'm going to use the same setup same torch and everything and a TIG finger to do a 6g sanitary tubing 2 inch weld test why 6g because if we lay it on the table and roll it we don't learn nothing besides someone out there might be about to take a test like this to get a job it might mean a difference between a paycheck and not so that's what we're doing either next or sometime very soon anyway may not be the next video but will be very soon and also work it's still working on this boom arm to hang that wire feeder off of for the MIG welder I'm still waiting on a part to come in and we will get it done but it it's coming shortly well thanks for watching and visit welding tips and tricks calm and remember I've got another site welding - tv.com where we use a different video service instead of YouTube because some schools are blocking YouTube now and the welding - tv.com site is also where you can purchase take fingers and DVDs and incidentally the 2012 youtube compilation package will be up there on welding - TV very soon", [' is', ' Jody', ' with', ' welding', ' tips', ' and', " tricks'", ' calm', " we're", ' going', '

(" British Prime Minister Theresa May is warning of further measures against Russia over the poisoning of that former double agent on British soil May's implied threat comes after Russia announced its expelling twenty-three British diplomats in light of their previous behavior we anticipated a response of this kind and we will consider our next steps in the coming days alongside our allies and partners Russia's move today matches the British government's action earlier this week for more let's turn to Dominic Politis in London so Dom a couple of major developments on this story today walk us through them that's right John Laurie Bristow that's Britain's ambassador to Russia was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry this morning where he was told that 23 British diplomats must leave the country within a week these are diplomats incidentally working at the UK's Embassy in Moscow and it is of course the exact same number of Russian diplomats that have been told to leave the UK by Wednesday the UK was also told today John that its consulate in st. Petersburg will be closed so too will the British Council in Russian this is an organization which promotes cultural ties between Britain and Russia now earlier we heard from Theresa May she was speaking at the Tory Party Spring Forum here in London here's how she reacted to the measures that Russia has announced this morning Russia's response doesn't change the facts of the matter the attempted assassination of two people on British soil for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable it is Russia that is in flagrant breach of international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention and Theresa May John as we heard earlier also raised the prospect of further measures being introduced against Russia she said that the UK would over the next few days be considering its next steps after consulting allies a hint there perhaps that we may see some multilateral measures being introduced against Moscow we know that the u.s. the EU Germany France and several Baltic states have declared their support for the UK so it's possible we may see further action over the coming days if we do expect the Russians to retaliate indeed russia's Foreign Ministry released the statement of its own this morning saying just that but it reserves the right to introduce further measures in case of other unfriendly actions again in its words John some are calling this a new Cold War and adding to that a warning from British authorities to Russian X Isles what can you tell us about that Dominic that's right on Monday the day that Theresa May blamed Russia for the Solsbury nerve agent attack a prominent Russian exile businessman and Kremlin critic by the name of Nikolai grush cough was found dead in his home here in London and a post-mortem has since found that he had died from compression to the neck suggesting he may have been strangled the British police have now launched a murder investigation although they say there's nothing at this point to link the killing with what happened in Solsbury earlier this month the authorities here have now begun to contact other Russian X Isles living here in the United Kingdom to discuss their safety as a precautionary measure Russia has said that they're willing to participate in this investigation although today's decision to expel these diplomats is essentially the messages this is what you get we heard from russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman ray there's a carava who's often kind of the blunt edge of the Kremlin response she said that this move comin says Moscow is angrily rejected of course these charges at the British government has levied against the Kremlin saying it's responsible for this poisoning of mr. script Paul and his daughter well it's reacted with anger to demands that they that Russia explain itself saying this is a presumption of guilt without any evidence they also say look we haven't actually been given access to this NOAA truck this weapons-grade nerve agent that the British say came from Russia and which Russian says it doesn't possess so but if you actually go in terms of public reaction what's happening here I think there's an assumption by many Russians that that you know 23 diplomats for twenty three diplomats you know that's normal that's politics at play you've seen some expressions of regret however over the decision to close the consulate in st. Petersburg and particularly the British Council just been a source of much cultural exchange between Russians and the Brits so I think but fundamentally after also keeping my politics might play a role here of course Latimer Putin is up for re-election tomorrow many expect he will win and this decision today Kremlin made no secret of it it was Vladimir Putin's decision today", [' British', '

(" hey guys so i'm here today to film another getting ready video i got a lot of positive feedback from my um last getting ready video and i was like you know i'll do it again because there's so much positive feedback thank you guys so much for um all the nice things you said too by the way um so i was figuring i have to film today so i might as well do another getting ready video and this time i'm using more high-end products i'm gonna go ahead and get started and clip my hair back i did curl my hair with my nume one inch clipless curling wand okay so today i'm actually going to be finishing up the same well this is the makeup forever um matt valet plus and i have this big light in front of me so i'm like blinded but um this is in number 40 and i just want to use this up because i have just like a little bit left i don't know if you can see because that light but um i have a little bit left so i'm gonna take this sigma f88 brush i love this brush for foundation it's one of my favorites and i'm just going to put this all over my face i think this is the foundation i'm gonna get the full size of because i think it's gonna be great for winter so this might be the one i get we'll have to see i just love like i said in one of my other videos you can just totally tell the difference between high-end foundations and drugstore foundations like when they're on your skin it's just it's insane how different they are and if i sound a little different or if i cough a lot or something i am getting kind of sick i like rarely get sick but ever since i started dating colton um every time he gets sick he like passes it on to me so now i'm going to take this dermablend concealer this is insable you've seen this so many times in my videos because i use it literally all the time apply a little bit of this on my cheeks just a tiny bit cover up any extra redness peeking through using that same brush just going to put that on my cheeks and blend it out i just love this foundation it looks so nice you guys if you haven't tried the makeup forever matte velvet plush you should because it's really nice i like a little toothpaste on it lip lips sorry and in the camera it looks or in the viewfinder doesn't look like my neck matches my face but i think it's just the lighting because it does match but bronzer will help that um going to do my under eye concealer i use this all the time the rimmel match perfection concealer and light i'm gonna use this today and i love this stuff i love it so good so placing that underneath my eyes a little bit of a triangle you can blend that my fingers under eye concealer is on just going to blend a little bit like with the tip of this brush and then i'm going to take of course the makeup forever hd powder love this stuff a lot of you are telling me maybe i won't be using that because i really don't feel like getting up the lush emotional brilliance powder i haven't used this in forever so that's what it looks like showed in a haul or i didn't show it in a haul because i didn't get it in my bag but i'm gonna be using this to set my under eye concealer and also just go ahead and set my face stuff so um take it and pat away oh crap i just like poured a buttload that's the only thing i hate this does not have a sifter at all so it's one of those things that just pisses you off when you try to work with it maybe that's why i haven't used it so long peg powder brush and i'm just going to put this all over this is a great matte powder if it had a sifter it'd be perfect and if you have the makeup forever powder does anyone else think it smells weird i think it smells kind of weird that might be the only one but it smells weird okay i'm going to take my chanel soleil 10-day chanel bronzer this is what it looks like and there's the back in case you're wondering about names and stuff this is what it looks like it's like a cream bronzer but if you have oily skin i've said this before don't be scared of it because it's not going to like be super creamy but this sort of goes on and it sort of dries to a powder it doesn't look like a cream at all it's very natural very very pretty um for this bronzer i'm using this crown brush contour brush or contour blush whatever i'm gonna use it for bronzer um a little bit of this stuff does go a long way so every time i swirl my brush and the product i will tap off excess and then i'll just start applying it where i would usually like apply like a contour why is my ear so red you guys see that um but i'll apply this where i usually apply my contour so right here and i'll just drag it up the side of my face and go to the top of my forehead and it's just a really nice natural bronzer like i'm obsessed with it can you tell the difference i love it so again tap off excess and just kind of contour with it okay now i'm just going to kind of buff out that contour just so it doesn't look too harsh with this crown brush brush i don't know what it's called um doesn't have a name on it but that's what it looks like it's like a big brush for brush you can use any sort of big dense brush and it'll work fine so there we go that's better right yep okay and i'm gonna go ahead and do blush and for today's blush i'm gonna be using the nars dan mori palette this is sin it's one of my favorite colors from nars i'm obsessed with it so this is the color i'll be using and i'm just going to apply that on my cheeks this is one of the colors that i would go out by the full size of because i love it so much especially for fall and winter it's really pretty okay now for eyes i'm gonna zoom you guys in okay so i'm going to take soft ochre from mac i'm going to prime my eyes and i have four mac shades that i'm going to be using today i'll go ahead and show you them um we have omega saddle which i used to talk about all the time got espresso and antique which is a really pretty color especially for fall so those are the kind of colors i'll be using today and the first one i'm going to take is saddle from mac and i'm going to take a blending brush i'm just going to put this in my crease like a transition color i hope you guys can see this okay and then we're going to take um antiqued so we're just going to take a flat shader brush that kind of looks like that this is the sigma e55 and we're going to take antiqued which is this color and i'm going to apply this sort of from the middle of my eye to the outer part to the outer v so just pour it in the middle and i'll apply it all over that's what we'll do so apply this color kind of lightly all over the lid i always end up changing my mind like right when i'm doing something then i'm going to take an angle brush like this nice angle brush taking from mac and take that angle brush and just deepen out the outer v then we're going to blend blem blend i know i keep looking the viewfinder but i'm trying to try to see if i'm in here and if i'm if you guys can see what i'm doing because last time you guys really wanted me to zoom in more i'm not going to zoom in really closely on like when i do face products because i kind of feel like that's pointless but everything else like eyes and stuff i'll zoom in on so that's what it looks like i'm going to take just a little bit of omega so just a little bit of omega i'm just going to kind of take this right above where saddle ends i'm really quickly going to take brulee from wet and wild see this is like one of those videos that you just do it as you go but i like those kinds of videos right so this is brulee it's a nice matte cream color from wet n wild i'm gonna put this right underneath my brow this is a gorgeous highlight great for drugstore wet n wild is so pigmented and it's definitely worth trying out if you've never tried them before putting this in my inner corner it's really like the inner part of the lid too just to brighten it up some all right and now we're going to take the l'oreal hip liner talk about this a lot so it looks like going to line my waterline now taking my favorite liquid liner this is the rimmel exaggerate liner that's what it looks like i've been completely obsessed with it and of course what am i gonna do i'm gonna do a winged liner so really quickly going to take this pencil brush taking um expresso from mac i'm going to smudge this underneath my bottom lash line then we're going to curl our lashes and apply some mascara i'll have a mascara routine video up soon if i don't have it up now if i have it up now i'll link it in this video because there's no point you see me do my mascara if i've already done a video on it so oh okay so these are the finished eyes they're nice simple kind of smoky but that's what i like for lip gloss i'm just gonna use nyx sugar pie it's just a nice nude color and that is it so i hope you guys enjoyed this little getting ready video there is the finished face i hope you guys enjoyed this video i know i probably didn't talk as much because i was like concentrating on stuff i needed i was wanting to do for makeup but i hope you guys enjoy this and i will see you all in the next video bye", [' hey', ' guys', ' so', " i'm", ' here', ' today', ' to',

(" so this is one cup of discard that I'm going to use to make two batches of popovers later today it's about 6:40 a.m. now and here I wanted to show you at about 10:40 the same day and the jar is practically bursting to the top so my starter is really active here are the ingredients that we'll use to make our popovers make sure that you heat your pan in the oven first and then we'll take our milk just one cup and heat that so it's just slightly warm we'll add this to our Bowl and then go ahead and add your three eggs here is our half cup of starter that we will add in and now I'm just going to whip it to break up those eggs and then add in our flour so now I've taken my preheated pan out of the oven and I'll show you guys both with a spray and with the extra-virgin olive oil so let's do the spray in this first pan and you don't need to spray each pan cup you just spray every other one because that's where we'll be putting our batter so fill these all the way up to the top and after they've baked we can see how easy it is to move around the popovers in the pan so the spray works great and now here's my second batch I'm going to demonstrate using the extra virgin olive oil for that one so this is the extra virgin olive oil and you just need a tiny bit in each of the cups that you're going to use make sure to coat it really well maybe get some on the top of the pan

(" hello everyone I hope you are doing well today my name is catalina for those who don't know me and her macramé ears on this channel I invite you to follow me on my social networks so you don't miss anything and also to subscribe to the channel so that they are the first to see the videos this sweetie was requested by and edited on facebook so thank you very much for the suggestion it taught you how to make the earrings for this sweetie but you can also just make the figure that is by taking it out of the part from the center I tell them how to do it and without anything else to say we start with the tutorial we start by taking a 15 centimeter candle and we talk it in the middle and there where it bends we place two 20 centimeter strands on one side and 2 others of 20 centimeters to the other side and we place it on the table with a clamp, leaving a little space above, then we are going to take one of the 12 o'clock 20 centimeters on the left, we pass the one on the left over it a on the right and we make a new half new cord to the left and a half cord knot to the right and then we make a new half cord to the left again and a half new cord to the right then we are going to take the 12 20 centimeter candles on the right side and we pass the truth on the right over the one on the left and make half a new bead to the right and half a new bead to the left and we repeat again half a new bead to the right and half a new bead to the with the threads on which they made the knots we are going to make a flat or square knot as you say and from this way and we are simply going to make one making all the threads in the middle or in our center and they do not move if they do not want to do the I recommend not placing the folded 15 centimeter strand at the beginning, it is the only thing that changes after this, we are going to remove our fabric from the table with tweezers and we are going to adjust the part of the little loop of the ring well, in this case I already told you a little shorter and that is done by pulling the middle strand the two middle strands that we placed at the beginning then I recommend cutting the small excess on top and burn them because later it becomes more complicated in this part, be careful to pull the loop of the ring to one side so as not to We reposition our fabric from the table with a clamp and we are going to add a 20-centimeter strand that will be a new plane or square on all the threads that we have and it is only a so that the threads remain symmetrical I recommend you to make the knot loose and not tighten until the ends join and then pull and tighten well and then continue tying the knot because only one if you added the thread from the beginning to do it with a ring I recommend that in this part you take them, which are the shortest threads, it shows and you cut them almost to the trace where we have the te jido and then you reposition the entire board with pieces because in the third thread reading from left to right you are going to add a 20 centimeter thread and with it you are going to make a new cord here I am making it loose without affirming it but you can affirm the same thread on the table with the piece and I recommend you make the new one super loose and then join the ends so that it is more symmetrical and then tighten the with one of the threads that we added that is more to the right we make a cord knot on the next vertical thread that we have on the other side we take another 20 centimeter era and do exactly the same as I tell you the new cord here I did it in the air without affirming it but you can perfectly affirm it I recommend leaving them loose and then joining the ends so that they are symmetrical. Do not forget to tighten the knot later, make the other one, which is in the next one, and we continue Doing the same thing with another 20 centimeter strand as well we repeat with another strand here I hold the strand firmly with my fingers so that it doesn't come loose so much and you can also do that after adding another strand in the same previous procedure doing the second knot as well and then a sixth thread that in we obviously add 6 now we are going to turn the fabric in such a way that the threads on the right are more towards us and in this way because we are going to work with them I put adhesive tape on the severe ones that are like the medium and also in the first two above because we are not going to use those for the moment now we are going to take a 20 centimeter strand of the color that you want I chose more or less this red a rare orange it we are going to fold it in half and on the first one it should be that it is not obviously with adhesive tape we are going to make a completely normal lark knot on the next one that is In this case, it is black, we are going to make a cord knot with one of the strands that we recently added, in this case, it is half red, orange, and then with the next one, now on the third black strand, we are also going to make a cord knot with the first thread but then we are going to add another thread here we take a 15 centimeter thread we fold it in half in this case black and hopefully it is black and we make a lark knot on the same one that we have been using and making the new previous cord and after tightening well we are going to make a cord knot with the other severe one, in this case half red we go to the fourth really black in this case and what we are going to do are cord knots with the medium red orange strands that we have we make a cord knot and then we make half a new cord again and ready later with the next one now we skip the black middle threads and with the next one we should also make a red half or even a new cord and then half on the fifth era we are going to make a cord knot with the first red orange medium thread that we have and then we are going to look for the short threads that we added from the black part we are going to make a knot lace with one of them any of the two finally the sixth was black we are going to tie a knot lace only one with one of the zebras half red orange that this part in the middle we have it ready so we turn the weaving thing and that the strands on the left remain on our side and we put adhesive tape as we did before also on the first strand we are going to make a lark knot with a 20-centimeter strand of the same red- orange color that we had and it is only a shoulder knot obviously previously we folded it in half then on the second strand we make cord knots with each of the strands it is exactly the same as we did on the other side after s on the third thread we make a cord knot with one of the threads and then we add a 15-centimetre length also with a lark knot but in this case it is a black thread after tightening well we make a cord knot with the following see here in this case it is orange red line then on the fourth strand we make a new bead with the first middle red strand that we have and after making that new bead we make another half new bead with the same letter and we do the same with the next era that we have red average orange we skip the strands in the middle that are black stockings then on the 5th strand we make a new bead with the first strand and then we look for one of the black strands and make a new bead and on the last strand the sixth we only make a new bead with the red orange middle strand that we have now we are going to remove the adhesive tapes that we had and we are going to separate the strands on the right side and on the left rda I put adhesive tape so they don't get confused and we are going to take the first threads from the top of the chinita and we are going to make a half lace knot to the right and a new half lace to the left about the truth that we did recently the cord knots we are going to make a cord knot with the following vera that we have later with the following ones and this is how we are doing this is to close the chinita and give it an edge and so we are doing until the end we also do a new cord with the thread in the middle, which in this case is on the left side now we turn the fabric over to do the same for the right side and we are going to separate the threads on the left side with adhesive tape as well, We take the strands on the right side of the chinita and we are going to make half a new cord to the left and half a new cord to the right on the strand that we made these knots. We are going to start To make the orbán knots as on the other side with all the severe ones that ] as on the previous side we also make a cord knot with the middle thread which in this case is on the right side we remove the figure we put it back on the table with clamps in this way and with the threads that remain in the middle that are a little longer we are going to make a new cord passing the one on the right over the one on the left in this part I recommend cutting only the strands in the middle, which later makes it more difficult, but only the ones in the middle so that they don't get confused, then we place the chinita on the table with clamps to make its legs and we take the first zebras from above and we're going to make the middle of a cord to the left and half a new lace to the right and then a new lace to the left this is on the left side of our little ones and we are going to leave it aside we skip a strand we take the following d and we make half a new cord to the left then to the right and then to the left it is exactly the same we skip another era we take the next two and make the same knots a half new cord to the left to the right and to the left I recommend you immediately cut and burn on the left side only from which we worked all the excesses and then carefully burn on the right side we do exactly the same thing we take the first two strands from the top and make half a new lace to the left half a new lace to the right and a half the new bead to the left again after this we skip one strand and take the next two to do exactly the same then we skip another strand and make exactly half a bead to the left to the right and to the left after finishing they go to cut all the excess and burn carefully so that it does not simmer. avalanche to make a ring, they open a little ring hook, first they take out what it has in the middle, they open it and place it in the little loop that we had from the beginning in the little one, obviously, then they close them with the pliers and put the pearlite and the spring the position and that way more or less their inks should fit. I hope you liked the video as much as I loved it because the chinita in hoops is too cute, especially as a nice detail, it's super cute, so I encouraged you to do it Send me your photos because remember that the April compilation is coming yes or yes and thank you very much for watching, don't forget to share the video so that many more people can learn to make macramé and now specifically

the', ' beginning', ' then', ' I', ' recommend cutting', ' the', ' small', ' excess', ' on top', ' and', ' burn', ' them', ' because', ' later', ' it becomes', ' more', ' complicated in', ' this', ' part,', ' be', ' careful', ' to', ' pull', ' the loop', ' of', ' the', ' ring', ' to', ' one', ' side', ' so', ' as', ' not', ' to We', ' reposition', ' our', ' fabric', ' from', ' the table', ' with', ' a', ' clamp', ' and', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' add', ' a 20-centimeter', ' strand', ' that', ' will', ' be', ' a new', ' plane', ' or', ' square', ' on', ' all', ' the threads', ' that', ' we', ' have', ' and', ' it', ' is', ' only', ' a so', ' that', ' the', ' threads', ' remain', ' symmetrical', ' I recommend', ' you', ' to', ' make', ' the', ' knot', ' loose', ' and', ' not tighten', ' until', ' the', ' ends', ' join', ' and', ' then pull', ' and', ' tighten', ' well', ' and', ' then continue', ' tying', ' the', ' knot', ' because', ' only', ' one if', ' you', ' added', ' the', ' thread', ' from', ' the', ' beginning', ' to do', ' it', ' with', ' a', ' ring', ' I', ' recommend', ' that', ' in', ' this part', ' you', ' take', ' them,', ' which', ' are', ' the', ' shortest', ' threads, it', ' shows', ' and', ' you', ' cut', ' them', ' almost', ' to', ' the trace', ' where', ' we', ' have', ' the', ' te', ' jido', ' and', ' then you', ' reposition', ' the', ' entire', ' board', ' with pieces', ' because', ' in', ' the', ' third', ' thread reading', ' from', ' left', ' to', ' right', ' you', ' are', ' going', ' to add', ' a', ' 20', ' centimeter', ' thread', ' and with', ' it', ' you', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' a', ' new cord', ' here', ' I', ' am', ' making', ' it', ' loose without', ' affirming', ' it', ' but', ' you', ' can', ' affirm', ' the same', ' thread', ' on', ' the', ' table', ' with', ' the', ' piece', ' and', ' I recommend', ' you', ' make', ' the', ' new', ' one', ' super', ' loose', ' and then', ' join', ' the', ' ends', ' so', ' that', ' it', ' is more', ' symmetrical', ' and', ' then', ' tighten', ' the with', ' one', ' of', ' the', ' threads', ' that we', ' added', ' that', ' is', ' more', ' to', ' the', ' right we', ' make', ' a', ' cord', ' knot', ' on', ' the next', ' vertical', ' thread', ' that', ' we', ' have', ' on', ' the other', ' side we', ' take', ' another', ' 20', ' centimeter', ' era', ' and do', ' exactly', ' the', ' same', ' as', ' I tell', ' you', ' the', ' new', ' cord', ' here', ' I', ' did', ' it', ' in', ' the air', ' without', ' affirming', ' it', ' but', ' you can', ' perfectly', ' affirm', ' it', ' I recommend', ' leaving', ' them', ' loose', ' and', ' then joining', ' the', ' ends', ' so', ' that', ' they', ' are symmetrical.', ' Do', ' not', ' forget', ' to

20', ' centimeter', ' strand', ' as', ' well we', ' repeat', ' with', ' another', ' strand', ' here', ' I', ' hold the', ' strand', ' firmly', ' with', ' my', ' fingers so', ' that', ' it', " doesn't", ' come', ' loose', ' so', ' much', ' and', ' you can', ' also', ' do', ' that', ' after', ' adding another', ' strand', ' in', ' the', ' same previous', ' procedure', ' doing', ' the', '

' a way', ' that', ' the', ' threads', ' on', ' the', ' right are', ' more', ' towards', ' us', ' and', ' in', ' this way', ' because', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' work', ' with', ' them I', ' put', ' adhesive', ' tape', ' on', ' the', ' severe', ' ones that', ' are', ' like', ' the', ' medium', ' and', ' also', ' in', ' the first', ' two', ' above', ' because we', ' are', ' not', ' going', ' to', ' use', ' those', ' for', ' the', ' moment now', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' take', ' a', ' 20 centimeter', ' strand', ' of', ' the', ' color', ' that', ' you want', ' I', ' chose', ' more', ' or', ' less', ' this', ' red a', ' rare', ' orange', ' it', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' fold', ' it', ' in half', ' and', ' on', ' the', ' first', ' one', ' it', ' should', ' be', ' that', ' it is', ' not', ' obviously', ' with', ' adhesive', ' tape', ' we', ' are', ' going to', ' make', ' a', ' completely', ' normal', ' lark', ' knot on', ' the', ' next', ' one', ' that', ' is', ' In', ' this', ' case,', ' it is', ' black,', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' a', ' cord', ' knot with', ' one', ' of', ' the', ' strands', ' that', ' we', ' recently', ' added, in', ' this', ' case,', ' it', ' is', ' half', ' red, orange,', ' and', ' then', ' with', ' the', ' next', ' one,', ' now on', ' the', ' third', ' black', ' strand, we', ' are', ' also', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' a', ' cord', ' knot', ' with', ' the first', ' thread', ' but', ' then', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' add another', ' thread here', ' we', ' take', ' a', ' 15 centimeter', ' thread', ' we', ' fold', ' it', ' in', ' half', ' in', ' this', ' case black', ' and', ' hopefully', ' it', ' is', ' black', ' and', ' we', ' make', ' a lark', ' knot', ' on', ' the', ' same', ' one', ' that we', ' have', ' been', ' using', ' and', ' making', ' the', ' new previous', ' cord', ' and', ' after', ' tightening well', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' a', ' cord', ' knot', ' with', ' the other', ' severe', ' one,', ' in', ' this', ' case', ' half', ' red we', ' go', ' to', ' the', ' fourth', ' really', ' black', ' in this', ' case', ' and', ' what', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' do', ' are cord', ' knots', ' with', ' the', ' medium', ' red orange', ' strands', ' that', ' we', ' have', ' we', ' make', ' a cord', ' knot', ' and', ' then', ' we', ' make', ' half', ' a', ' new cord', ' again', ' and', ' ready', ' later', ' with', ' the next', ' one', ' now', ' we', ' skip', ' the black', ' middle', ' threads', ' and', ' with', ' the', ' next', ' one', ' we should', ' also', ' make', ' a', ' red', ' half', ' or even', ' a', ' new', ' cord', ' and', ' then', ' half on', ' the', ' fifth', ' era', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' a cord', ' knot', ' with', ' the', ' first red', ' orange', ' medium', ' thread', ' that', ' we', ' have', ' and', ' then', ' we', ' are', ' going to', ' look', ' for', ' the', ' short', ' threads', ' that we', ' added', ' from', ' the', ' black', ' part', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to make', ' a', ' knot', ' lace', ' with', ' one', ' of', ' them any', ' of', ' the', ' two finally', ' the', ' sixth', ' was', ' black', ' we', ' are', ' going to', ' tie', ' a', ' knot', ' lace', ' only', ' one', ' with one', ' of', ' the', ' zebras', ' half', ' red', ' orange', ' that this', ' part', ' in', ' the', ' middle', ' we', ' have', ' it', ' ready so', ' we', ' turn', ' the', ' weaving', ' thing', ' and that', ' the', ' strands', ' on', ' the', ' left remain', ' on', ' our', ' side', ' and', ' we', ' put adhesive', ' tape', ' as', ' we', ' did', ' before also', ' on', ' the', ' first', ' strand', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to make', ' a', ' lark', ' knot', ' with', ' a 20-centimeter', ' strand', ' of', ' the', ' same', ' red- orange', ' color', ' that', ' we', ' had', ' and', ' it', ' is', ' only', ' a shoulder', ' knot', ' obviously', ' previously', ' we folded', ' it', ' in', ' half', ' then', ' on', ' the second', ' strand', ' we', ' make', ' cord', ' knots', ' with each', ' of', ' the', ' strands', ' it', ' is', ' exactly', ' the same', ' as', ' we', ' did', ' on', ' the', ' other', ' side', ' after', ' s on', ' the', ' third', ' thread', ' we', ' make', ' a cord', ' knot', ' with', ' one', ' of', ' the', ' threads', ' and', ' then we', ' add', ' a', ' 15-centimetre', ' length also', ' with', ' a', ' lark', ' knot', ' but', ' in', ' this case', ' it', ' is', ' a', ' black', ' thread after', ' tightening', ' well', ' we', ' make', ' a cord', ' knot', ' with', ' the', ' following', ' see', ' here', ' in', ' this case', ' it', ' is', ' orange', ' red', ' line then', ' on', ' the', ' fourth', ' strand', ' we', ' make a', ' new', ' bead', ' with', ' the', ' first middle', ' red', ' strand', ' that', ' we', ' have', ' and', ' after making', ' that', ' new', ' bead', ' we', ' make', ' another', ' half new', ' bead', ' with', ' the', ' same', ' letter', ' and we', ' do', ' the', ' same', ' with', ' the', ' next', ' era that', ' we', ' have', ' red', ' average', ' orange', ' we skip', ' the', ' strands', ' in', ' the', ' middle', ' that', ' are black', ' stockings then', ' on', ' the', ' 5th', ' strand', ' we', ' make', ' a new', ' bead', ' with', ' the', ' first', ' strand', ' and then', ' we', ' look', ' for', ' one', ' of', ' the black', ' strands', ' and', ' make', ' a', ' new', ' bead', ' and', ' on the', ' last', ' strand', ' the', ' sixth', ' we only', ' make', ' a', ' new', ' bead', ' with', ' the red', ' orange', ' middle', ' strand', ' that', ' we', ' have now', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' remove', ' the', ' adhesive', ' tapes that', ' we', ' had', ' and', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' separate', ' the strands', ' on', ' the', ' right', ' side', ' and', ' on', ' the

' with', ' the following', ' ones', ' and', ' this', ' is', ' how', ' we', ' are', ' doing', ' this', ' is to', ' close', ' the', ' chinita', ' and', ' give', ' it', ' an', ' edge and', ' so', ' we', ' are', ' doing', ' until', ' the', ' end we', ' also', ' do', ' a', ' new', ' cord', ' with the', ' thread', ' in', ' the', ' middle,', ' which', ' in', ' this', ' case', ' is on', ' the', ' left', ' side now', ' we', ' turn', ' the', ' fabric', ' over', ' to', ' do the', ' same', ' for', ' the', ' right', ' side and', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' separate the', ' threads', ' on', ' the', ' left', ' side', ' with', ' adhesive', ' tape', ' as', ' well, We', ' take', ' the', ' strands', ' on', ' the', ' right', ' side', ' of', ' the chinita', ' and', ' we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' make', ' half', ' a', ' new cord', ' to', ' the', ' left', ' and', ' half', ' a', ' new cord', ' to', ' the', ' right', ' on', ' the', ' strand that', ' we', ' made', ' these', ' knots.', ' We', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' start To', ' make', ' the', ' orbán', ' knots', ' as', ' on the', ' other', ' side', ' with', ' all', ' the', ' severe', ' ones', ' that ]', ' as', ' on', ' the', ' previous', ' side', ' we also', ' make', ' a', ' cord', ' knot', ' with', ' the middle', ' thread', ' which', ' in', ' this', ' case', ' is', ' on', ' the', ' right', ' side we', ' remove', ' the', ' figure', ' we', ' put', ' it', ' back on', ' the', ' table', ' with', ' clamps', ' in', ' this', ' way', ' and with', ' the', ' threads', ' that', ' remain', ' in', ' the', ' middle that', ' are', ' a', '

I', ' recommend', ' cutting only', ' the', ' strands', ' in', ' the', ' middle,', ' which later', ' makes', ' it', ' more', ' difficult,', ' but', ' only the', ' ones', ' in', ' the', ' middle', ' so', ' that', ' they', " don't", ' get', ' confused, then', ' we', ' place', ' the', ' chinita', ' on', ' the', ' table with', ' clamps', ' to', ' make', ' its', ' legs', ' and we', ' take', ' the', '

' and', ' then', ' a', ' new', ' lace to', ' the', ' left', ' this', ' is', ' on', ' the left', ' side', ' of', ' our', ' little', ' ones', ' and we', ' are', ' going', ' to', ' leave', ' it', ' aside', ' we', ' skip', ' a strand', ' we', ' take', ' the', ' following', ' d', ' and we', ' make', ' half', ' a', ' new', ' cord', ' to', ' the left', ' then', ' to', ' the', ' right', ' and then', ' to', ' the', ' left', ' it', ' is exactly', ' the', ' same we', ' skip', ' another', ' era', ' we', ' take', ' the next', ' two', ' and', ' make', ' the', ' same knots', ' a', ' half', ' new', ' cord', ' to', ' the left', ' to', ' the', ' right', ' and', ' to', ' the', ' left I', ' recommend', ' you', ' immediately', ' cut', ' and burn', ' on', ' the', ' left', ' side', ' only', ' from which', ' we', ' worked', ' all', ' the', ' excesses', ' and then', ' carefully', ' burn on', ' the', ' right', ' side', ' we', ' do', ' exactly the', ' same', ' thing', ' we', ' take', ' the', ' first', ' two', ' strands from', ' the', ' top', ' and', ' make', ' half', ' a new', ' lace', ' to', ' the', ' left', ' half', ' a new', ' lace', ' to', ' the', ' right', ' and', ' a', ' half', ' the new', ' bead', ' to', ' the', ' left again', ' after', ' this', ' we', ' skip one', ' strand', ' and', ' take', ' the', ' next', ' two to', ' do', ' exactly', ' the', ' same then', ' we', ' skip', ' another', ' strand', ' and make', ' exactly', ' half', ' a', ' bead to', ' the', ' left', ' to', ' the', ' right', ' and', ' to', ' the left', ' after', ' finishing', ' they', ' go', ' to cut', ' all', ' the', ' excess', ' and', ' burn carefully', ' so', ' that', ' it', ' does', ' not', ' simmer.', ' avalanche to', ' make', ' a', ' ring,', ' they', ' open', ' a', ' little', ' ring', ' hook,

(" so it came in a good rain and I came into the garage I believe it's a good time to do a little more maintenance I'm thinking changing the blades maybe taking the deck off and painting underneath the deck preventing that future rust yeah let's get started on that so I've not pulled this deck yet but it looks pretty easy there's one pin in the front and there's two pins in the back and the belt and in the front pin so now we'll take these old blades off and they had about a 3/8 inch gap that's why they were leaving a mohawk I'll tell the blades off get the fresh wash clean all this muck out put some paint on it then we'll set the new blades on ratchet strap so after hitting the deck with a pressure washer I have found some rust we go in for a closer look those are big flakes of rust that are chipping off will chip those off because some sandpaper do a little more pressure washing not put some primer and some paint on let's see if we can get a couple more years out up before it gets holes in it maybe next year I can win the zero turn instead of the push mower and there's the mower in the background waiting for its date to go back home once the deck rust out that's not gonna make a very good mud more after about 30 minutes of beaten on the rust I'm given up on it we've lost public by a pound of what used to be metal I've now got me some Oslo Rufus applause foam that prepares the rusty surface for painting then we've got some heavy-duty primer for rusty surfaces and we've got some red paint if we look at the topside the topside load good my first started but this paint pills kind of like someone I don't fete the pain if it's a powder coat know what it is so we're gonna put a little oslo on this side too and we'll do some prominent and we'll put some red on so I'm out working on the mower deck and the sprinklers have come on I got to hurry up the grass is gonna be too tall and I'm on the Oslo step you're supposed to put it all near it in let it dry all night and then it turns to us and some kind of black and nurse metal not rust chemical change will be going on it won't be arrested anymore so let us do all night the more will do some painting it is the very next day approximately 24 hours later checking out the deck and what the Oslo did you do flip it over and check the other side hang on second so here is the bottom of the deck they said it dust off any drop powder and start painting back on the lower deck they promise let's try I think I'll lay it down and put another coat on and then we'll put a little red paint on it I'm gonna put the blades on it then we'll put it back on until okay so the mower deck the primer is all dry I got the red paint I'm gonna flip it over and put some red on it then on the bottom we'll put some red till we run out if we run out any coloring on the bottom hold me long won't be moment and now the mower deck is looking fairly red okay the paint is now dry we're gonna put these blades on and these are an aggressive looking blade the only thing left to do now is to put this chute back on and to put the deck back on and we are done well done and even though my deck was pretty rusty at least we caught it before it got to be this bad that's what happens and this is a before-and-after of the blades that was the cutting edge like a butter knife so we line up the spring-loaded pin it goes in the hole and then the front pin and then the front pan does in just like that one more step in radom are done it's time to mow [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is the old garden spot it's not a garden anymore it's just weed now I think I'll raise the blade ups if we can go through it on the other side you'll see my motor motor [Music] I'm gonna take you for a round along I'll control this with one hand and the camel with the other hand you can see what it looks like going through the jungle so on the old garden we went on a level four I have beside the garden that was a level two think that's good and I've been mulling probably an hour let's check on the blades one the pain off of them I think up next I'll hit this area I'm not gonna bother to video I'll just show you the before and after here's the four and this is the after get in one time on level seven I'll come back in a week or so get it again or deck off the zero turn paint and replace some blades I'm just curious how good it is of a hill climber usually it climbs good until the bottoms out some will go down to the ditch truck on my better side without the deck on it", [' so', ' it', ' came', ' in', ' a', ' good', ' rain', ' and', ' I', ' came', ' into', ' the', ' garage', ' I', ' believe', " it's", ' a', ' good', ' time', ' to', ' do', ' a', ' little', ' more', '

' are', ' big', ' flakes', ' of', ' rust', ' that', ' are', ' chipping', ' off', ' will', ' chip', ' those', ' off', ' because', ' some', ' sandpaper', ' do', ' a', ' little', ' more', ' pressure', '

(" so you're saying i can make my own window cleaner hey guys and welcome to the very first monthly e-o diy that's essential oil do it yourself now i know that there are lots of recipes that you can look up online and it'll give you instructions on how to make different things but i have found that a lot of people myself included like to be shown how to do something so that's what we're going to do today today we're going to be making a window and counter cleaner and a lemon toilet bomb which i've never made before so we'll see how that goes alright so let's start with this lemon spray this is going to be such a versatile and useful cleaner for you to have around your home it's super inexpensive and the only ingredients you'll need are a glass spray bottle one half a cup of distilled water a half a cup of white vinegar and eight drops of lemon or another citrus oil of your choice now there are several different places you can get your glass bottles from this particular one i'm using today comes from a site called aromatools.com and their website will be in the details listed below and i really like their bottles because they're heavy duty and i can choose from a wide array of sizes when i'm working on a new recipe so let's get started now the first thing i'm going to do is add my white vinegar now i'm going to use a funnel today and you don't have to use a funnel but i always make a really big mess and i thought for the sake of this video i will use a funnel so that none of you can make fun of me for the massive mess i would make following so add my half a cup of white vinegar into the bottle like so then i'm going to take my half a cup of distilled water i don't like these pictures i'm still making a mess it doesn't matter if i'm in the funnel or not but i'm just going to make a mess it doesn't really matter so you too can make a mess at home but you're gonna have a really great cleaner and then you're gonna add your eight drops of essential oil i can't talk and count at the same time literally going to just screw on the cat now shake it up you have your counter cleaner it really is just as simple as that and that's really all there is to it just shake it every time before you use it and i wish that you guys could smell it because it smells so clean and fresh and not chemically if i if that's even a word but you might be saying now lindsay i don't have a glass bottle and even if i order one i'm not going to get one for like a while well you're in luck because there are ways that you can use lemon oil to clean your glass and counters without a glass bottle let me show you just dropping some drops of lemon oil onto your counter and then taking a warm damp rag and wiping down the surface is all that you need you can also do the same thing with your windows tip the oil bottle onto your rag and wipe those windows down remember lemon oil has such amazing cleansing properties in it that makes it not only good for our counters but good for our bodies now on to the experiment the lemon toilet bomb for this you're going to need a large glass pitcher one cup of baking soda one cup of vinegar and five to six drops of lemon oil now from what i've read this might be a really fun experiment to do if you have kids or if you're just a big kid at heart like me so you're going to want to add the ingredients in this order the vinegar first do your 1 cup of vinegar into your large bowl or pitcher the lemon oil 5 to 6 drops and finally the baking soda now this is where i'm getting kind of nervous because this i really have never done this before so welcome you're going to live this out with me all right so are we ready one cup of baking soda added to the mixture it's all oh and stuff all right let's go to the bathroom before it foams out somehow showing you the inside of a toilet felt a little weird so needless to say all i did was dump all that foamy magic goodness down into my toilet i'm gonna let it sit for a little while and then eventually i'll flush it down it'll clean out that inner ring of my toilet it'll also clean out those pipes all naturally and it smells smells really really good remember there are tons

(" hello I'm Amy Wilcock and I'm the food and lifestyle writer for the shooting Gazette and today I'm going to be showing you how to prepare game birds so let's take a look at what we have here there's a brace of pheasants a [ __ ] and a hen and you'll be given one of these braces when you leave your shoot now make sure don't just go away with anything make sure you get the right bird and that means actually checking their breasts because you want to have a nice plump bird have a good look at your bird so take them home take the string off them and have a look see what they've been shot because you want to be a bit more ginger with the plucking in those areas and the other thing you want to do is you want to age your birds so a really easy way of aging a bird is to look at their beak and to look at in on a [ __ ] bird the Spurs and the feet if the Spurs aren't very long you know you've got a youngish bird and if the feet are sort of tender not very calloused again you know you've got a young bird okay so here we are we're going to start plucking them we're all ready you want to try and do this in an area where there isn't a lot of wind outside is good if you can find us a wind free corner and you may want to put down some newspaper and I just have a bit of wax paper here as well so the first place you want to start plucking a pheasant indeed any game bird is the leg and you want to start with short sharp tugs of the feathers you really don't want to tear the skin so once the legs are pretty well complete just a few little stragglers on the ends here which we can tidy up later turn the bird over and do the back and really try not to tear the skin we don't want to tear the skin some of the longer ones are a bit tougher but again try and go right down to the base and if you need to hold the skin because tortoise skin will make it easier for the feathers to come out now we're just going to turn our bird over and do the front really actually have got a lot done again just keep on short sharp tugs so here we have our pheasant pretty well almost there as you can see you want to leave a nice amount of neck exposed because it just makes the whole thing easier and we're going to take the wings off I suggest you buy a really good pair of poultry shears that works well take those off that and you want to just take the wing and you want to cut it off we can trim up the feathers at that first joint but to get all these tiny bits of quill out we're just going to hold it over candle if you have a gas ring I don't have gas here but if you have gas just hold it over a gas flame if you leave the legs on at this stage it makes it really easy to hold as well it's much better if you can get the tendons out before you roast the bird it just makes the eating really really tough so again just take your poultry shears and cut but not all the way through so you can just pull out the tendon sometimes they come out evenly sometimes you really do have to tug away now that our bird is plucked and the head is removed we're now going to draw the bird and drawing it simply means cutting a small slit in the vent hooking two fingers into the bird and drawing out the entrails it's as simple as that so there's the vent and you'll find that there are some little bones there so the best thing to do is just cut snip through them can be a bit smelly just put your finger in and loosen everything up and then put your two fingers in try and hook them round try and pull everything out in one go a drawn bird and there we have a pheasant all ready for cooking", [' hello', " I'm", ' Amy', ' Wilcock', ' and', " I'm", ' the', ' food', ' and', ' lifestyle', ' writer', ' for', ' the', ' shooting', ' Gazette', ' and', ' today', " I'm", ' going', ' to', '

(" hey there this is Mike I wanted to do a quick little video for people who are trying to make popcorn you're having trouble so the first thing you need to make sure is that you're on saute you've adjusted it too high and that the pot says it's hot okay now I'm going to take three tablespoons measured out already and pour it in there okay now make sure I would swirl it around a little bit just by lifting the pot white handle okay now see how the pot went for a second vector on came off a hot you have to make sure that this says hot again before you put your popcorn in and I would actually wait for probably another full minute or so because it's really important that the oil gets nice and hot before you put the popcorn in and then this recipe just calls for tablespoons of oil and a quarter cup of popcorn so we're going to add this in mix it around move it just swirl up a big deal okay and then you put your top on you don't have to have the glass lid I just do because it's so I use it for other things okay and again this is hot again and in it sure it takes a little while to get hot and ready to pop but it shouldn't take like 10 minutes or anything okay now you can see the popcorn in there popping a bit this is toward the end of the popping run and still going so whenever I do this like that almost all of that quarter cup of popcorn kernels popped so it's it's slowing down now it's still going okay I turned the pot off now that's still actually popping but you know as you can see that's pretty pretty full of popcorn from that quarter cup so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to get like two tablespoons of butter and probably about half a teaspoon of salt and dump in there and stir it around and then I'm gonna have some popcorn the last thing I wanted to show you before I go is how many popcorn kernels are left now remember we started with a quarter cup and there's what maybe maybe a couple of dozen kernels left so again this it does work it works great for popcorn but you have to make sure that the pot is really hot and especially after you add the oil wait a minute or two until it boils really hot and then add your popcorn and enjoy and I will see you next time bye-bye", [' hey', ' there', ' this', ' is', ' Mike', ' I', ' wanted', ' to', ' do', ' a', ' quick', ' little', ' video', ' for', ' people', ' who', ' are', ' trying', ' to', ' make', '

(" if your FoodSaver came with a marinade container you can marinade meat very quickly so if you forgot to do it overnight you can do it in about 10 minutes while you're getting other things ready for dinner I've got a pork chop in here with a cranberry orange marinade and I filled it so that it completely covers the pork chop I've left about an inch of space so don't get it too high and make sure everything that goes in here is cool you don't want to put hot liquids in when you're marinating here's the lid for the marinade container it has a suction lid at the top and there are a couple of settings I'm going to use this one that says open it tells me that this will marinate with a v3 model and I know the V 3840 if you have a different model you might use the setting on the other side so this is set to open and I'm going to just match up this little lip with the one on the bottom and press down as firmly as possible the hose for the accessories is down at the bottom finishing just pull that out it's got a little nozzle and push that in as far as you can into this knob at the top so now with my machine on I'm going to turn on marinade it will vacuum this out and then let it stay vacuum for a bit then it goes off back in for a minute so it runs about three cycles while that gives and then you'll get a beef at the end when it's all finished so once it's done you can use it right away or put it in a smaller container and keep it in the fridge until you need it see the liquid just starting to bubble a little bit so just flash here while it's working and it will go through couple of these cycles so you'll have to be a little bit patient but it's better than letting it go overnight as long as that light is flashing at the side you know it's still working and now it's releasing the vacuum here a little hissing sound so it lets it rest for about 30 seconds and then it will start the process again so it does that a couple more times and then you'll be done starting up the vacuum again so now it's finished and it's beeping to let me know that I can come and turn it off turn it off I just press any button and that stops the beeping and then I can remove as you can hear the vacuum seal was certainly effective and then you be able to open it and take out your meat and use it", [' if', ' your', ' FoodSaver', ' came', ' with', ' a', ' marinade', ' container', '

(" okay our coffee collaboration for today is brewing a pour-over coffee with hot milk I know you're saying that sounds really unusual and strange but hey that's what I asked for send in the unusual and the strange recipes we're going to try them this one was sent in by mace Jam and what she does is 21 grams of medium coarse for pour over use your favorite coffee and then she has milk heated up to 140 degrees and she does to 300 grams of milk so we're going to try it personally I say this is not going to work but hey that's what we're here for so let's try it we've already pre moistened the filter you know she didn't say if she pre and does the bloom on it but we're going to do like you normally would let me tear this out okay it's a little easier to control actually well the coarseness

(" so this is a shepherd's pie style meatloaf I guess I should just call it small @ style meatloaf and like their mom I'm not putting any bread in this meatloaf at all we are putting a ton of vegetable I started with mushrooms you can use any type you like I love hand of the woods click out the mushroom first then add in a couple of shallots garlic i rib of celery a carrot in a little time you have to cook that out and cool that completely you can't add of course hot food to cold meat so we're going to add to our ground beef pound and a half to two pounds of ground sirloin so nice and lean we're gonna add all of that cooled cooked out vegetable and thyme then we're gonna add the flavor enhancers a fat three to four tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce a little soy sauce or tamari aged soy a squirt of tomato paste or sun-dried tomato paste a fat squirt of Dijon mustard mmm a little chopped parsley and my special ingredient finely chopped corn II Shawn or pickles weird but delicious just try it shush just try it it's really really good and then we're gonna add in one large egg and then we're going to form a loaf drizzle it with olive oil and pop it in a 400 degree oven on a parchment lined baking sheet for 45 minutes then we're gonna take the loaf out top it with our potato topping my everything mashed potato topping I didn't put it back in the oven to brown the potatoes I'll show you what goes in the potatoes right after this [Applause] [Music] so we got the meatloaf heavy with condiments it's got Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard a lot of great flavors already going through the meatloaf now we're gonna top it with everything smashed potatoes so for the potatoes you're gonna start by baking your bacon always bake bacon never put it in a frying pan it makes a mess of your stove and it's uneven heating you're gonna end up with pockets of the bacon that are overcooked and pockets that are undercooked you bake it you never have to flip it you take it out when it's extra crispy and crumble it then you get bacon bits I use small potatoes so you don't have to peel them duh and then you mash them up I don't care any color small potato baby potatoes cold water cold potatoes bring that up to a rapid boil then salt the water potatoes love salt once the potatoes come to a boil take the lid off or the pot will you know overflow all over the stove because of the starch never salted potatoes until the waters boiling because the salt will fall to the bottom of the pot if the water isn't boiling it'll scar the pot itself then we add in tons of bacon bits I already have butter salt and pepper in there bacon bits green onion or chive sour cream it's best friend and some grated Gruyere or cheddar cheese and then save a little for the top now if you have an obsession with bacon as I do make twice the amount of bacon that I tell you in the recipe because you're just going to eat it while you're in the kitchen making meatloaf because it's bacon and that's how that rolls that's just the way it works out so now we're going to mash that all together and then we're gonna slather this all over the meatloaf and put it back in our 400 degree oven until it turns brown and bubbly and gorgeous so it's just like shepherd's pie except it's a loaf yeah I don't know why this makes me so happy but it truly does so here we go gonna roll like the Smollett family right here gorgeous look at that baby oh you're so beautiful oh I want to take a class picture of you don't you talk to your food at home I made my dad unusual anyway wouldn't you get that slathered around top it with a little extra cheese why not guys check this out cheesy everything mashed potatoes on top of the meatloaf that kind of has everything in the world and it meatloaf for the cheesy potatoes and then the easiest of side dishes roast broccolini [Applause]", [' so', ' this', ' is', ' a', " shepherd's", ' pie', ' style', ' meatloaf', ' I', ' guess', ' I', ' should', '

(" so it's been a little while since I've recorded a video figured I get one out I've been working on this this econo plate will hopefully be my new bottle cap bottle opener fixture plate if you look a couple videos back you'll see me milling one of these is my bottle cap bottle opener up until this point I've only milled one at a time and look to start milling a lot more at a time I've already mailed a prototype of the fixture and basically just what I repeat that prototype design 21 times in this new fixture plate this fixture will actually be for milling the tops of the bottle caps the bottoms will still be milled just in the vise I might make make a fixture in the future sometime but for the moment I'm just putting these 10 inch by 3 inch pieces in the vise and milling them like this the fixture will hold like I said 21 so in the end I'll be holding ball caps kind of in this fashion but across the whole plate unlike the old fixture plates I made this one I'll be able to load without having to remove it from the vise which should save me a lot of time I have the fix I mean a prototype here it's basically a pneumatic cylinder the cylinder raises and lowers this set of jaws here I have a fixed jaw and a movable jaw movable jaws a little spring so when I want to load a ball cap let us take the ball cap bottom the unfinished bottom and just snap it on by pressing the movable jaw a little bit like that that's all it takes to uh essentially load it on I guess it's not totally done then what I'll have to do is press it down a little bit by hand and align it with the dowel pins that I have in there and then I'll activate a foot switch which will put some air into the top of the cylinder and lock the ball kept down on to the fixture at that point the machine can come in and mill it and then when it's done I'll apply air to the other side of the cylinder which releases the ball cap and I'll just have to come and you know do the reverse of putting it on to get the ball cap off just like that I'll have my finished bottle cap on the top I thought I'd show it work in a couple times before I take it apart here so like I said I just put air in through the side to clamp it down and this side to release it and we'll go back and forth you can't do it too quick manually here but that's a job just goes up and down I think it's gonna be really cool when all 21 are going at the same time oh yeah forgot to mention so I would like this to be the first in a series of videos where I show milling the remainder of this large fixture plate I'd like to get into some SolidWorks and some HS HSN works as well as just showing the actual machine if you guys have any questions or would like me to focus more on any specific part of it please put a comment down below I'm sure if it's relevant I'll try to address it as best I can my plan at the moment is to make it least at least two more videos one showing the milling of the two jaws and one showing the milling of the base I may have up to 5 more videos maybe a few more than that even we'll see of the other parts I'd say there's basically five main parts of this and I'll kind of talk about them as I take this apart I suppose all right this part I'm calling the seal plate it's pretty simple not likely I'll make a video on this now basically all it does is hold this o-ring in okay this is the piston I make it to this there's not a whole lot to this really it's round the only thing that might be worthy of a video is that I cut this gland or along the edge of it these are the two jaws I will definitely make a video showing this I want to basically just redraw it in SolidWorks and then cam it in HSN works oh you know maybe it'll be helpful to somebody will see these are extremely boring I don't think I'll get this on video but no maybe they're just little short sections of 12 Alf or twelve elf 14 steel and they're just three it's in diameter with a number 10 screw clearance all through drilled through and all they do is connect the piston to the jaws on top pin like that that's kind of nice how accurate and I close tolerance I made this piston it's like it's barely any smaller in there so the base is definitely the main event I plan to mill this you know as soon as I can make a soon as I can get those a video out and have it be half decent really so there's a cylinder that obviously the piston rides up and down in and then two holes that allow these two shafts to go through and then there's the gland for the o-ring on top the top of it you pretty much saw it earlier but it just holds the bottle cap squarely prevents it from I mean securely prevents it from moving around and also it locates it accurately so that what I machined the top half I don't get a little seam between the top and bottom halves oh one quick thing so when I was making this I basically milled this entire base and got it finished and then I drilled this hole and what's what's in the front of this I think in that funnel art it's gonna be in the back tilt this whole thread milled 1/8 inch npt you know I guess hole in there tapped hole and I was working great I tested it everything was great and then I decided that our chip for it and before I chamfered it I accept well I didn't accidentally do it but I extended my chamfering mill and it's to a holder by about six millimeters but I forgot to remeasure the tool so when I went to chamfer it instead of basically just making this hole a little prettier it plowed into it and made it much bigger than it was supposed to be you can actually kind see a little divot where you know it's a very thin wall of aluminum right there so in the final version there'll be a an air fitting skirt in here just like this but for this I just stuck the two of in there and filled the rest of it with epoxy and put this little washer on there to try to keep it all together it seems to be working okay I've mailed five bottle caps using the sectional fixture in it it seems to work so I'm very happy with it but you know though there'll be no epoxy on the final version all right I think I'll end this video here like I said if you have any comments or places where you'd like me to pay extra attention let me know this isn't the 100% final design I'm going to change this piston a tiny bit actually I can't think of any other changes but there might be a little couple of changes here and there see you in the next one", [' so', " it's", ' been', ' a', ' little', ' while', ' since', " I've", ' recorded', ' a', ' video', ' figured', ' I', ' get', ' one', ' out', " I've",

pieces', ' in', ' the', ' vise', ' and', ' milling', ' them', ' like', ' this', ' the', ' fixture', ' will', ' hold', ' like', ' I', ' said', ' 21', ' so', ' in', ' the', ' end', " I'll", ' be', ' holding', ' ball', ' caps', ' kind', ' of', ' in', ' this', ' fashion', ' but', ' across', ' the', ' whole', ' plate', ' unlike', ' the', ' old', ' fixture', ' plates', ' I', ' made', ' this', ' one', " I'll", ' be', ' able', ' to', ' load', ' without', ' having', ' to', ' remove', ' it', ' from', ' the', ' vise', ' which', ' should', ' save', ' me', ' a', ' lot', ' of', ' time', ' I', ' have', ' the', ' fix', ' I', ' mean', ' a', ' prototype', ' here', " it's", ' basically', ' a', ' pneumatic', ' cylinder', ' the', ' cylinder', ' raises', ' and', ' lowers', ' this', ' set', ' of', ' jaws', ' here', ' I', ' have', ' a', ' fixed', ' jaw', ' and', ' a', ' movable', ' jaw', ' movable', ' jaws', ' a', ' little', ' spring', ' so', ' when', ' I', ' want', ' to', ' load', ' a', ' ball', ' cap', ' let', ' us', ' take', ' the', ' ball', ' cap', ' bottom', ' the', ' unfinished', ' bottom', ' and', ' just', ' snap', ' it', ' on', ' by', ' pressing', ' the', ' movable', ' jaw', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' like', ' that', " that's", ' all', ' it', ' takes', ' to', ' uh', ' essentially', ' load', ' it', ' on', ' I', ' guess', " it's", ' not', ' totally', ' done', ' then', ' what', " I'll", ' have', ' to', ' do', ' is', ' press', ' it', ' down', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' by', ' hand', ' and', ' align', ' it', ' with', ' the', ' dowel', ' pins', ' that', ' I', ' have', ' in', ' there', ' and', ' then', " I'll", ' activate', ' a', ' foot', ' switch', ' which', ' will', ' put', ' some', ' air', ' into', ' the', ' top', ' of', ' the', ' cylinder', ' and', ' lock', ' the', ' ball', ' kept', ' down', ' on', ' to', ' the', ' fixture', ' at', ' that', ' point', ' the', ' machine', ' can', ' come', ' in', ' and', ' mill', ' it', ' and', ' then', ' when', " it's", ' done', " I'll", ' apply', ' air', ' to', ' the', ' other', ' side', ' of', ' the', ' cylinder', ' which', ' releases', ' the', ' ball', ' cap', ' and', " I'll", ' just', ' have', ' to', ' come', ' and', ' you', ' know', ' do', ' the', ' reverse', ' of', ' putting', ' it', ' on', ' to', ' get', ' the', ' ball', ' cap', ' off', ' just', ' like', ' that', " I'll", ' have', ' my', ' finished', ' bottle', ' cap', ' on', ' the', ' top', ' I', ' thought', " I'd", ' show', ' it', ' work', ' in', ' a', ' couple', ' times', ' before', ' I', ' take', ' it', ' apart', ' here', ' so', ' like', ' I', ' said', ' I', ' just', ' put', ' air', ' in', ' through', ' the', ' side', ' to', ' clamp', ' it', ' down', ' and', ' this', ' side', ' to', ' release', ' it', ' and', " we'll", ' go', ' back', ' and', ' forth', ' you', " can't", ' do', ' it', ' too', ' quick', ' manually', ' here', ' but', " that's", ' a', ' job', ' just', ' goes', ' up', ' and', ' down', ' I', ' think', " it's", ' gonna', ' be', ' really', ' cool', ' when', ' all', ' 21', ' are', ' going', ' at', ' the', ' same', ' time', ' oh', ' yeah', ' forgot', ' to', ' mention', ' so', ' I', ' would', ' like', ' this', ' to', ' be', ' the', ' first', ' in', ' a', ' series', ' of', ' videos', ' where', ' I', ' show', ' milling', ' the', ' remainder', ' of', ' this', ' large', ' fixture', ' plate', " I'd", ' like', ' to', ' get', ' into', ' some', '

would', ' like', ' me', ' to', ' focus', ' more', ' on', ' any', ' specific', ' part', ' of', ' it', ' please', ' put', ' a', ' comment', ' down', ' below', " I'm", ' sure', ' if', " it's", ' relevant', " I'll", ' try', ' to', ' address', ' it', ' as', ' best', ' I', ' can', ' my', ' plan', ' at', ' the', ' moment', ' is', ' to', ' make', ' it', ' least', ' at', ' least', ' two', ' more', ' videos', ' one', ' showing', ' the', ' milling', ' of', ' the', ' two', ' jaws', ' and', ' one', ' showing', ' the', ' milling', ' of', ' the', ' base', ' I', ' may', ' have', ' up', ' to', ' 5', ' more', ' videos', ' maybe', ' a', ' few', ' more', ' than', ' that', ' even', " we'll", ' see', ' of', ' the', ' other', ' parts', " I'd", ' say', " there's", ' basically', ' five', ' main', ' parts', ' of', ' this', ' and', " I'll", ' kind', ' of', ' talk', ' about', ' them', ' as', ' I', ' take', ' this', ' apart', ' I', ' suppose', ' all', ' right', ' this', ' part', " I'm", ' calling', ' the', ' seal', ' plate', " it's", ' pretty', ' simple', ' not', ' likely', " I'll", ' make', ' a', ' video', ' on', ' this', ' now', ' basically', ' all', ' it', ' does', ' is', ' hold', ' this', ' o-ring', ' in', ' okay', ' this', ' is', ' the', ' piston', ' I', ' make', ' it', ' to', ' this', " there's", ' not', ' a', ' whole', ' lot', ' to', ' this', ' really', " it's", ' round', ' the', ' only', ' thing', ' that', ' might', ' be', ' worthy', ' of', ' a', ' video', ' is', ' that', ' I', ' cut', ' this', ' gland', ' or', ' along', ' the', ' edge', ' of', ' it', ' these', ' are', ' the', ' two', ' jaws', ' I', ' will', ' definitely', ' make', ' a', ' video', ' showing', ' this', ' I', ' want', ' to', ' basically', ' just', ' redraw', ' it', ' in', ' SolidWorks', ' and', ' then', ' cam', ' it', ' in', ' HSN', ' works', ' oh', ' you', ' know', ' maybe', " it'll", ' be', ' helpful', ' to', ' somebody', ' will', ' see', ' these', ' are', ' extremely', ' boring', ' I', " don't", ' think', " I'll", ' get', ' this', ' on', ' video', ' but', ' no', ' maybe', " they're", ' just', ' little', ' short', ' sections', ' of', ' 12', ' Alf', ' or', ' twelve', ' elf', ' 14', ' steel', ' and', " they're", ' just', ' three', " it's", ' in', ' diameter', ' with', ' a', ' number', ' 10', ' screw', ' clearance', ' all', ' through', ' drilled', ' through', ' and', ' all', ' they', ' do', ' is', ' connect', ' the', ' piston', ' to', ' the', ' jaws', ' on', ' top', ' pin', ' like', ' that', " that's", ' kind', ' of', ' nice', ' how', ' accurate', ' and', ' I', ' close', ' tolerance', ' I', ' made', ' this', ' piston', " it's", ' like', " it's", ' barely', ' any', ' smaller', ' in', ' there', ' so', ' the', ' base', ' is', ' definitely', ' the', ' main', ' event', ' I', ' plan', ' to', ' mill', ' this', ' you', ' know', ' as', ' soon', ' as', ' I', ' can', ' make', ' a', ' soon', ' as', ' I', ' can', ' get', ' those', ' a', ' video', ' out', ' and', ' have', ' it', ' be', ' half', ' decent', ' really', ' so', " there's", ' a', ' cylinder', ' that', ' obviously', ' the', ' piston', ' rides', ' up', ' and', ' down', ' in', ' and', ' then', ' two', ' holes', ' that', ' allow', ' these', ' two', ' shafts', ' to', ' go', ' through', ' and', ' then', " there's", ' the', ' gland', ' for', ' the', ' o-ring', ' on', ' top', ' the', ' top', ' of', ' it', ' you', ' pretty', ' much', ' saw', ' it', ' earlier', ' but', ' it', ' just', ' holds', ' the', ' bottle', ' cap', ' squarely', ' prevents', ' it', ' from', ' I', ' mean', ' securely', ' prevents', ' it', ' from', ' moving', ' around', ' and', ' also', ' it', ' locates', ' it', ' accurately', ' so', ' that', ' what', ' I', ' machined', ' the', ' top', ' half', ' I', " don't", ' get', ' a', ' little', ' seam', ' between', ' the', ' top', ' and', ' bottom', ' halves', ' oh', ' one', ' quick', ' thing', ' so', ' when', ' I', ' was', ' making', ' this', ' I', ' basically', ' milled', ' this', ' entire', ' base', ' and', ' got', ' it', ' finished', ' and', ' then', ' I', ' drilled', ' this', ' hole', ' and', " what's", " what's", ' in', ' the', ' front', ' of', ' this', ' I', ' think', ' in', ' that', ' funnel', ' art', " it's", ' gonna', ' be', ' in', ' the', ' back', ' tilt', ' this', ' whole', ' thread', ' milled', ' 1/8', ' inch', ' npt', ' you', ' know', ' I', ' guess', ' hole', ' in', ' there', ' tapped', ' hole', ' and', ' I', ' was', ' working', ' great', ' I', ' tested', ' it', ' everything', ' was', ' great', ' and', ' then', ' I', ' decided', ' that', ' our', ' chip', ' for', ' it', ' and', ' before', ' I', ' chamfered', ' it', ' I', ' accept', ' well', ' I', " didn't", ' accidentally', ' do', ' it', ' but', ' I', ' extended', ' my', ' chamfering', ' mill', ' and', " it's", ' to', ' a', ' holder', ' by', ' about', ' six', ' millimeters', ' but', ' I', ' forgot', ' to', ' remeasure', ' the', ' tool', ' so', ' when', ' I', ' went', ' to', ' chamfer', ' it', ' instead', ' of', ' basically', ' just', ' making', ' this', ' hole', ' a', ' little', ' prettier', ' it', ' plowed', ' into', ' it', ' and', ' made', ' it', ' much', ' bigger', ' than', ' it', ' was', ' supposed', ' to', ' be', ' you', ' can', ' actually', ' kind', ' see', ' a', ' little', ' divot', ' where', ' you', ' know', " it's", ' a', ' very', ' thin', ' wall', ' of', ' aluminum', ' right', ' there', ' so', ' in', ' the', ' final', ' version', " there'll", ' be', ' a', ' an', ' air', ' fitting', ' skirt', ' in', ' here', ' just', ' like', ' this', ' but', ' for', ' this', ' I', ' just', ' stuck', ' the',

(" a mason jar so glass and time did for cold drinks you can even put snacks in here you're getting a set of three with matching boxes for $19.98 and we have two easy payments on this so that breaks down to under $10 and that's with any major credit card here are your choices so you have the red here down below is the blue and then you have the green and notice all the boxes match back the caps match back and this part right here that is glass and by the way these are 16.9 so almost 17 ounces here why a mason jar mm well mason was the original jar and there's so much to Ball jars mason jars yeah history and they're so they're really cute but it's all about the glass glass just just such a nice thing to put your beverages and it's clean it washes clean is not picking up stains or odors or anything keeps things nice and fresh but this is a leak proof totally leak proof so the top twists on just like this it has a silicone seal on the inside that keeps it airtight as well you can see that right on here and all you do is put it on the top just like this okay and now look at this you've got a great opening right here see how big that opening it is why is that important well if you want to do something like put your lemons and your lives and making your infused water in there you've got enough room for drink that also enough room if you want to use a straw this will snap back on the top it clicks back so that stays back for you it's not real lapping on you having from it remember this is just for cold beverages you're not gonna put your hot coffees and teas in here and then when you want to seal it to go which is great for kids in the car you seal it just like that there you go you know I do smoothies in my Vitamix and I use the mason jars like just the normal ones so then when I have the cover when I take the cover off it's like it's I'm a messy drinker so this is nice because it just it's like it's it's a nice flow of your smoothie of your drink of whatever it is but as Marie Louise was saying it's intended for cold drinks but you know what being glass you can there we go I'm showing the pour it will sell if you don't close yeah well no I was trying to show the poor but um but it being glass you can also put snacks in yeah it's great for portion control that way even little salads or something oh I love that and I love that everybody can see in the refrigerator what's in there with their beverage but not at that point - this is a great way to present it so putting in your chocolate candies or making your own spice blend or the little chocolate kisses in here or we solve so many popcorn makers I think they are great echolution popcorn maker you can give somebody popcorn or wrap sugar candies or pretzels up here you can see doing the little cookie jar mixes this makes a really great vessel for doing that and then when you're done you have this to reuse some of our squirrel brand silver and gold card I'm gonna steal one of those because I love ya pretty good we're doing your own little hot chocolate mix I'm here and these are it's an easy way to gift those things you know it's budget-friendly because you're getting a set of three for under $20 so all you do and they even come with the gift boxes right so you can bow and go yeah you can do one of those ideas that Marie Louise Ludwig just showed us with little pretzels or popcorn or whatever and pop it right into this box or you can just keep it in the box and add the bow and you're done so you only choose do you want the red do you want the blue or do you want the green for two easy payments of $9.99 with any major credit card and it's easy and you're right you know glass is just clean mm-hmm it just looks nice look at all the things that we've done right down here on the bottom you can put your milk in there you can put your juice your juice drink your chocolate milk your lemonade your cranberry juice all down here it is so important every time of year to stay hydrated I mean it just is and it's so nice to be able to perhaps make these beverages up ahead of time and have them already ready to go on the refrigerator for the kids on the go these your protein shakes and remember it's it's this simple this I'm going to take this off this thing I think so this looks just like a mason jar one of those the old-fashioned mason jars I do a lot of canning I make jam I would make jam in this mason jar this is the lid right here there's a silicone seal which makes it airtight and watertight and leak proof so you don't cure setup right no no I mean you probably could if you're really change the seat delay and you could use those caning the rings that go on the top you could actually put those on there if you wanted to but this is all about the drink so you open this up on the top this will click back like this you've got a nice big opening right here which makes it really easy to drink you've got that little air pocket right here which gives a great flow ability also room if you want to put a straw in and then when it closes up just like this it becomes leak proof and leak proof is important if you don't want things all over your car I spill the kids back I still spell now miss Spiller like it's because when it has a wide handle I don't know I like the flow to be portion controlled in my drink that's why the straws have been invented I'm not the only one now when we get these dirty top rack dishwasher and then I just like to put this in a little basket on the side or just rinse these out on here but look at the chocolate candies you could put a gift card in there if you want just use it for is a nice little way to give a praise you can put like some paper confetti and hide it would they wouldn't even know that then it was in there you'd have to tell them it's like a little scavenger hunt here's the thing - you know your colors are the red blue and green it's a set of three I know we're thinking holidays because Christmas is two weeks away we have you know the day of enlightenment just behind that so I know we're thinking holidays but these colors are not just holiday so if you want to pick up a couple for you know Easter gifts maybe have some birthday gifts or some other kind of gifting things coming up that would be an easy way to do it and get you know get started early so here's the red set of three here's the blue set of three and remind you the boxes match back and the green set of three for under $20 item number K for nine five two and remember you have two easy payments on this - 150 of these were ordered I

schnapps like in general my stuff is strong these I mean it is it's put it the proof it isn't what gets me know why it's pepper man city and and even i remember i think ian had handed me a bottle once in college and it was no it was a aftershock one of the pepper yeah but I thought is that cinnamon receptor I have a cinnamon what they have uh oh they do have a preference and so I I drank it and like it was a shot or something straight stupid college thing right through a shot of the stuff in it was so vibrant like I choked a little bit so i gagged [ __ ] so then it shot up my nose and then I could end so it's out it is the old and in pain because now you can't do anything because everything stinks you're crying this like just your eyes your water if you have an issue sore throat like it hurts it burn your throat for whatever reason maybe because it's like up in the nasal passage just like Isis bad i don't know what i did but ever since then i've just had like this almost a gag reflex with the frenum it's just very hard to drink yeah the peppermint I love to minute uh and that makes that like you're taking the shotgun open nice and minty flavor afterward oh yeah I'm good to go for hours just I can go I wouldn't like out on the town and everybody's gonna take I just brushed my teeth mm-hmm okay so once it stops killing you there's actually a nice flavor to this drink but initially it is overwhelming peppermint you just gonna make through the first 30 seconds yeah you really need to like peppermint it's like a roller coaster and then afterwards it actually tastes quite nice yeah you can make it through the peppermint it's like when you go up down the roller coaster at first like oh they get down here like I wasn't so bad hmm the only last like two seconds no roller coasters yeah was a longer what does of the remanence though no bad no it's like a Indies can you tell ya it the truck cuz of the chocolate with this the chalk it brings chocolate so bring it just leave it in there Irish malt yeah cacao yeah I don't know coca coca whatever something in Finnell um so that's that's some crazy that's some craziness I'm glad I had a good reaction now i wish i was

" it's", ' pepper', ' man', ' city', ' and', ' and', ' even', ' i', ' remember', ' i', ' think', ' ian', ' had', ' handed', ' me', ' a', ' bottle', ' once', ' in', ' college', ' and', ' it', ' was', ' no', ' it', ' was', ' a', ' aftershock', ' one', ' of', ' the', ' pepper', ' yeah', ' but', ' I', ' thought', ' is', ' that', ' cinnamon', ' receptor', ' I', ' have', ' a', ' cinnamon', ' what', '

' stupid', ' college', ' thing', ' right', ' through', ' a', ' shot', ' of', ' the', ' stuff', ' in', ' it', ' was', ' so', ' vibrant', ' like', ' I', ' choked', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' so', ' i', ' gagged', ' [', ' __', ' ]', ' so', ' then', ' it', ' shot', ' up', ' my', ' nose', ' and', ' then', ' I', ' could', ' end', ' so', " it's", ' out', ' it', ' is', ' the', ' old', ' and', ' in', ' pain', ' because', ' now', ' you', " can't", ' do', ' anything', ' because', ' everything', ' stinks', " you're", ' crying', ' this', ' like', ' just', ' your', ' eyes', ' your', ' water', ' if', ' you', ' have', ' an', ' issue', ' sore', ' throat', ' like', ' it', ' hurts', ' it', ' burn', ' your', ' throat', ' for', ' whatever', ' reason', ' maybe', ' because', " it's", ' like', ' up', ' in', ' the', ' nasal', ' passage', ' just', ' like', ' Isis', ' bad', ' i', " don't", ' know', ' what', ' i', ' did', ' but', ' ever', ' since', ' then', " i've", ' just', ' had', ' like', ' this', ' almost', ' a', ' gag', ' reflex', ' with', ' the', ' frenum', " it's", ' just', ' very', ' hard', ' to', ' drink', ' yeah', ' the', ' peppermint', ' I', ' love', ' to', ' minute', ' uh', ' and', ' that', ' makes', ' that', ' like', " you're", ' taking', ' the', ' shotgun', ' open', ' nice', ' and', ' minty', ' flavor', ' afterward', ' oh', ' yeah', " I'm", ' good', ' to', ' go', ' for', '

okay', ' so', ' once', ' it', ' stops', ' killing', ' you', " there's", ' actually', ' a', ' nice', ' flavor', ' to', ' this', ' drink', ' but', ' initially', ' it', ' is', ' overwhelming', ' peppermint', ' you', ' just', ' gonna', ' make', ' through', ' the', ' first', ' 30', ' seconds', ' yeah', ' you', ' really', ' need', ' to', ' like', ' peppermint', " it's", ' like', ' a', ' roller', ' coaster', ' and', ' then', ' afterwards', ' it', ' actually', ' tastes', ' quite', ' nice', ' yeah', ' you', ' can', ' make', ' it', ' through', ' the', ' peppermint', " it's", ' like', ' when', ' you', ' go', ' up', ' down', ' the', ' roller', ' coaster', ' at', ' first', ' like', ' oh', ' they', ' get', ' down', ' here', ' like', ' I', " wasn't", ' so', ' bad', ' hmm', ' the', ' only', '

I'm going to start this off with some garlic rosemary and an onions and I'm also going to add a little bit of bacon next let's talk about our sausage okay here we go sausages you can use any sausage you like you can use a beef pork a chicken or vegetable sausage entirely up to you even if you want maybe go for like a trade show or something a little bit more spicy what I'm using today and as you can see I've cooked my sausages already because I'm just going to throw them in to the stew a bit later I needed a beautiful I'm got a pork and leek sausage really lovely I really love these ones so very lucky to have them so just cook them a little bit stuck them on the side let them cool down let's get over to the cooker ok so let's get started you're going to need a kind of big pan or saucepan I'm going to use a wok today to say you guys can see what's going on it's much easier to see so I've got some oil in there which I'm getting really nice and hot going to start off by dropping in garlic which I've just sliced roughly and chop it if you want and then some onion into that I'm going to add our celery it's a little bit like to say everything's optional here really you can add any type of vegetable you want and then I've got some bacon here or some pancetta if you want it up just roughly chopped out I've got a smoked bacon we're going to add a little bit of black pepper a touch of salt and then we're simply gonna throw this around in the pan I'm gonna cook this on a pile of lively eat as you can hear get to about two to three minutes it's looking absolutely wonderful that something nice flavors that mean we're going to do now to add I've got some fresh rosemary I'm just going to throw them in just like that on quite a pin familiy to chop them then we're going to add our route or our hardest vegetables this is out sweet haha now carrots sweet potatoes or potato option there goes our parsnips and finally a leek now you can make this as kind of luxurious what I mean by that is and more ingredients as you like or the less you can just do this with onions garlic sausages and beans if you want it really simple I'm really kind of going for it today this really box it out gives it loads of flavor and it feeds lots of people and really good for you okay so let's now cook that for about four to five minutes on this kind of medium to high heat okay it's going on nicely I mean obviously these vegetables are really still very hard that's why I'm going to add here to touch of water now you could use a stock if you wanted I'm not a big fan of stock unless it's freshly made and we've got plenty of flavors in here already so I don't see it as any meat so a little bit of liquid in there as you can see we're now going to turn the heat up on this get this kind of braids in a little bit just to give a head start for those vegetables we're still going to add our mushrooms fresh tomatoes a tin of tomatoes or can of tomatoes in the can of beans and our sausages so five or six ingredients still to go but we've got a beautiful base here and this is really really gonna be worth it I'll be back in about five or six minutes and say okay this is coming on really nicely and those vegetables and the other ingredients have made a lovely broth anyway there was no need for me to use stock so I'm going to add now some fresh chopped tomatoes you've got a few button mushrooms just grab them zucchini could work in this eggplant anything goes really the more you put in more goodness you're gonna get so again let's cook this for about another five minutes give it a stir every now and it wonderful tomatoes have broken down a little bit I'm mushrooms are cooking and look at that wonderful wonderful goodness of all those vegetables okay now the can of tomatoes add which I've chopped then a mix and a time for our sausage cook sausage I'm using this beautiful pork sausages today I'll just cut them in half you know leave them the whole or chop them into the little bits if you wanted so we've now got an amazing amazing stew here what at least I think so so let's cook this for about six minutes now on a kind of medium heat giving it a stir every now and then we're then going to add the last thing is our bait spins okay this is looking absolutely wonderful if you ask me really happy with this and finally now let's everybody get a can of baked beans in their sauce get them in the reason I had them at the end is because there's quite a lot of sugar in the can of or tin or cattle of your call it of beans and we put it in too early it can burn quite easily so again another final mix if you wanted to get out a little bit of chili there now with a cane or some chili flakes it might be nice you know check this for salt and pepper it's going to be fine for me we're going to let that go for just a number four to five minutes on a kind of low to medium heat that's it guys all done like I say play around with it add what those symbols you like you

(" hey guys so today i'm going to try to do a little bit better attempt at um showing you how to recycle candles um the downside with some of the recycling is that you're not necessarily going to achieve um a nice perfect clean wax because as you can see there's um definitely like some soot in there from the wick so i mean this isn't gonna be something that's like a perfected technique or anything but um you know just when you get these larger candles there is quite a bit of waste for example i had this one in the container and i accidentally broke the container but this was made up of like maybe um four candles five candles and as you can see the wax pour is not real great it's kind of layered because um i did this over a period of time and i'm gonna re-melt it today and make new candles out of it since i broke the container but this is like all sandalwood citrus and ocean side so you can like um for bath and body works so you can like make new um scents and stuff with it with all that wax waste that you get so um i've got a few of the sandalwood citrus so i'm gonna try my best to hold the phone and um show you what i'm doing so actually i think i might go set that there okay so what i'm doing is i'm taking the tongs these are just regular kitchen tongs with like a rubber handle and i'm grabbing the edge of the container and um i'm taking like a hot pad you know use oven mitt type thing for the bottom to hold it as i pour and i'm going to try my best to pour as quickly and evenly as possible into the new container which i've already placed to wick in and um ideally you find a way to secure the wick i tried to get as much of the black stuff out of there as i could um ideally i have like a whole set up with like popsicle sticks and stuff but i just got done moving and i'm still trying to find things so um i don't have my popsicle sticks at the moment so i'm going to just try to find actually these tongs double really well for that kind of thing but i'm going to be needing them so i'm not going to do that but that's an option so we see we're going to find something we can use just for a second while i do that because you want to stabilize the wick as best you can that's not gonna work either because um otherwise you get slanting in there and you're not gonna have a good nice even burn and you get some slack in the wick once you add hot wax so you definitely want to make sure you find a way to stabilize the wick as best you can and unfortunately i didn't think this through and i'm not having a whole lot of luck so let me see if i can work either i have popsicle sticks that like have a hole drilled in the middle and then i use like um clothes pit wooden clothes pins and those work probably the best without having to go into anything expensive or buying the actual they're essentially the same thick thing as the uh like wick stabilizers you can buy that are the metal ones you can buy those for candle making but um so basically well that's sitting there i'm doing another one so you just want to fill i actually filled this up a little bit higher than i typically do because i've got some um candles that i'm still like like this one i've got to melt because i tried to redo this and like not do it the right way and my wicks got buried so i need to do it properly this head broke and i tried to squeeze the back and body works handle from an old jar i know in your jar and it didn't work out well so um i put it back in the boiling water and just wait for a while for it to melt you can kind of once you start getting the wax pulling around the edge if you want to hurry it along and kind of like push the wax down and like let it seep up over the sides it'll help it um kind of speed it up so um once you get the water boiling it really doesn't take a whole lot of time and i can even tip it and do that try to get the hot wax over the rest of it and make it melt a little faster it only takes you know a couple minutes to get them melted if you have a larger pot you could always do that so you can do like more than one at once um i guess i could have done that but my hot pads aren't very big so um i don't get an even distribution of heat if i do that so hopefully this will melt quickly but um anyway well that's doing that um i go to um i go to various like resale stores because i was doing candle making for a little while but uh it turned out to not be really uh profitable to do so um now i use a lot of the stuff for recycling and i'll go find things you know people have dropped off at resale places and um i picked containers up that would be good for candles these are excuse me ikea cups like teacups and these wicks you can buy them at pretty any pretty much any craft store or you can buy them online you can do one of a couple of things to secure the wick to the bottom you can see this is a little off-center you can either use they make like this wick um like it's a putty in a in a little round container and you like roll that between your fingers and stick the base of the wick to the bottom and let it dry or you can use um like a a like craft elmer's makes like a craft uh glue that you can use with ceramics and that works pretty good i haven't had any trouble with that either so um i find all these different containers or like if they put things on clearance like that um i'll use those kind of containers this was actually supposed to be like a display for um you put like a little boutique in there or something but i'm actually gonna use it to fill it up so it looks like our wax is pretty much getting there melted wise so i'm at like seven minutes into the video and i've already gotten my second one done so that kind of gives you a good gauge of how long this takes per you know per uh carton i guess but also keep in mind that since these are there's less wax in these it's going to take a lot less time than when i'm going to try to do that ski lodge one for math and body works so let's uh go over here again get ready for our second pour i'm gonna move the knife and hopefully i'll have i won't run out or run out of space in there rather again try to go as evenly as possible quickly as possible voila so now that'll probably take it really depends on how long it takes to cool with a smaller container like this it'll probably take a couple of hours for it to really solidify but i would recommend um just kind of leaving them be overnight because that way um you can sort of ensure that nothing's gonna be accidentally like because if you move it too soon or do anything you're gonna get these kind of like little divots and really the proper way you're supposed to do it is you're supposed to like save a little bit of extra wax to be able to fill kind of fill that in but um i'm not really going to do that so next thing i'm going to do and i'm not going to go to my sink and exactly show you but i'm going to take while it's still kind of warm i'm going to run some cool water over the bottom on the outside so i can stand to handle it and then um while the inside of it's still warm it makes it really easy to get these tabs off so i can kind of get them off of my fingernail or i can take like a butter knife or something and pull out those tabs and i'm going to wipe out the inside real good so i can reuse this container for candles or i can reuse it for storage purposes in this case i'm going to use it to um after i clean it out to re-melt this wax so that i can put it in another container so um i hope that kind of helped you guys and that you find ways to reuse your candles or use your containers um i try to make the best of all of mine and you know then i get to re-enjoy scents that i've already loved and i mean like look at all that wax in there that's like quite a bit of wax and it's already burned out so i like to be able to re-enjoy the scents that um that i've really loved so uh thanks for watching and have a great night", [' hey', ' guys', ' so', ' today', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' try', ' to', ' do', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' better', ' attempt', ' at', ' um', ' showing', ' you', ' how', ' to', ' recycle', ' candles', ' um', ' the', ' downside', ' with', ' some', ' of', ' the', ' recycling', ' is', ' that', " you're", ' not', ' necessarily', ' going', ' to', ' achieve', ' um', ' a', ' nice', ' perfect', ' clean', ' wax', ' because', ' as', ' you', ' can', ' see', " there's", ' um', ' definitely', ' like', ' some', ' soot', ' in', ' there', ' from', ' the', ' wick', ' so', ' i', ' mean', ' this', " isn't", ' gonna', ' be', ' something', " that's", ' like', ' a', ' perfected', ' technique', ' or', ' anything', ' but', ' um', ' you', ' know', ' just', ' when', ' you', ' get', ' these', ' larger', ' candles', ' there', ' is', ' quite', ' a', ' bit', ' of', ' waste', ' for', ' example', ' i', ' had', ' this', ' one', ' in', ' the', ' container', ' and', ' i', ' accidentally', ' broke', ' the', ' container', ' but', ' this', ' was', ' made', ' up', ' of', ' like', ' maybe', ' um', ' four', ' candles', ' five', ' candles', ' and', ' as', ' you', ' can', ' see', ' the', ' wax', ' pour', ' is', ' not', ' real', ' great', " it's", ' kind', ' of', ' layered', ' because', ' um', ' i', ' did', ' this', ' over', ' a', ' period', ' of', ' time', ' and', " i'm", ' gonna', ' re-melt', ' it', ' today', ' and', ' make', ' new', ' candles', ' out', ' of', ' it', ' since', ' i', ' broke', ' the', ' container', ' but', ' this', ' is', ' like', ' all', ' sandalwood', ' citrus', ' and', ' ocean', ' side', ' so', ' you', ' can', ' like', ' um', ' for', ' bath', ' and', ' body', ' works', ' so', ' you', ' can', ' like', ' make', ' new', ' um', ' scents', ' and', ' stuff', ' with', ' it', ' with', ' all', ' that', ' wax', ' waste', ' that', ' you', ' get', ' so', ' um', " i've", ' got', ' a', ' few', ' of', ' the', ' sandalwood', ' citrus', ' so', " i'm", ' gonna', ' try', ' my', ' best', ' to', ' hold', ' the', ' phone', ' and', ' um', ' show', ' you', ' what', " i'm", ' doing', ' so', ' actually', ' i', ' think', ' i', ' might', ' go', ' set', ' that', ' there', ' okay', ' so', ' what', " i'm", ' doing', ' is', " i'm", ' taking', ' the', ' tongs', ' these', ' are', ' just', ' regular', ' kitchen', ' tongs', ' with', ' like', ' a', ' rubber', ' handle', ' and', " i'm", ' grabbing', ' the', ' edge', ' of', ' the', ' container', ' and', ' um', " i'm", ' taking', ' like', ' a', ' hot', ' pad', ' you', ' know', ' use', ' oven', ' mitt', ' type', ' thing', ' for', ' the', ' bottom', ' to', ' hold', ' it', ' as', ' i', ' pour', ' and', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' try', ' my', ' best', ' to', ' pour', ' as', ' quickly', ' and', ' evenly', ' as', ' possible', ' into', ' the', ' new', ' container', ' which', " i've", ' already', ' placed', ' to', ' wick', ' in', ' and', ' um', ' ideally', ' you', ' find', ' a', ' way', ' to', ' secure', ' the', ' wick', ' i', ' tried', ' to', ' get', ' as', ' much', ' of', ' the', ' black', ' stuff', ' out', ' of', ' there', ' as', ' i', ' could', ' um', ' ideally', ' i', ' have', ' like', ' a', ' whole', ' set', ' up', ' with', ' like', ' popsicle', ' sticks', ' and', ' stuff', ' but', ' i', ' just', ' got', ' done', ' moving', ' and', " i'm", ' still', ' trying', ' to', ' find', ' things', ' so', ' um', ' i', " don't", ' have', ' my', ' popsicle', ' sticks', ' at', ' the', ' moment', ' so', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' just', ' try', ' to', ' find', ' actually', ' these', ' tongs', ' double', ' really', ' well', ' for', ' that', ' kind', ' of', ' thing', ' but', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' be', ' needing', ' them', ' so', " i'm", ' not', ' going', ' to', ' do', ' that', ' but', " that's", ' an', ' option', ' so', ' we', ' see', " we're", ' going', ' to', ' find', ' something', ' we', ' can', ' use', ' just', ' for', ' a', ' second', ' while', ' i', ' do', ' that', ' because', ' you', ' want', ' to', ' stabilize', ' the', ' wick', ' as', ' best', ' you', ' can', " that's", ' not', ' gonna', ' work', ' either', ' because', ' um', ' otherwise', ' you', ' get', ' slanting', ' in', ' there', ' and', " you're", ' not', ' gonna', ' have', ' a', ' good', ' nice', ' even', ' burn', ' and', ' you', ' get', ' some', ' slack', ' in', ' the', ' wick', ' once', ' you', ' add', ' hot', ' wax', ' so', ' you', ' definitely', ' want', ' to', ' make', ' sure', ' you', ' find', ' a', ' way', ' to', ' stabilize', ' the', ' wick', ' as', ' best', ' you', ' can', ' and', ' unfortunately', ' i', " didn't", ' think', ' this', ' through', ' and', " i'm", ' not', ' having', ' a', ' whole', ' lot', ' of', ' luck', ' so', ' let', ' me', ' see', ' if', ' i', ' can', ' work', ' either', ' i', ' have', ' popsicle', ' sticks', ' that', ' like', ' have', ' a', ' hole', ' drilled', ' in', ' the', ' middle', ' and', ' then', ' i', ' use', ' like', ' um', ' clothes', ' pit', ' wooden', ' clothes', ' pins', ' and', ' those', ' work', ' probably', ' the', ' best', ' without', ' having', ' to', ' go', ' into', ' anything', ' expensive', ' or', ' buying', ' the', ' actual', " they're", ' essentially', ' the', ' same', ' thick', ' thing', ' as', ' the', ' uh', ' like', ' wick', ' stabilizers', ' you', ' can', ' buy', ' that', ' are', ' the', ' metal', ' ones', ' you', ' can', ' buy', ' those', ' for', ' candle', ' making', ' but', ' um', ' so', ' basically', ' well', " that's", ' sitting', ' there', " i'm", ' doing', ' another', ' one', ' so', ' you', ' just', ' want', ' to', ' fill', ' i', ' actually', ' filled', ' this', ' up', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' higher', ' than', ' i', ' typically', ' do', ' because', " i've", ' got', ' some', ' um', ' candles', ' that', " i'm", ' still', ' like', ' like', ' this', ' one', " i've", ' got', ' to', ' melt', ' because', ' i', ' tried', ' to', ' redo', ' this', ' and', ' like', ' not', ' do', ' it', ' the', ' right', ' way', ' and', ' my', ' wicks', ' got', ' buried', ' so', ' i', ' need', ' to', ' do', ' it', ' properly', ' this', ' head', ' broke', ' and', ' i', ' tried', ' to', ' squeeze', ' the', ' back', ' and', ' body', ' works', ' handle', ' from', ' an', ' old', ' jar', ' i', ' know', ' in', ' your', ' jar', ' and', ' it', " didn't", ' work', ' out', ' well', ' so', ' um', ' i', ' put', ' it', ' back', ' in', ' the', ' boiling', ' water', ' and', ' just', ' wait', ' for', ' a', ' while', ' for', ' it', ' to', ' melt', ' you', ' can', ' kind', ' of', ' once', ' you', ' start', ' getting', ' the', ' wax', ' pulling', ' around', ' the', ' edge', ' if', ' you', ' want', ' to', ' hurry', ' it', ' along', ' and', ' kind', ' of', ' like', ' push', ' the', ' wax', ' down', ' and', ' like', ' let', ' it', ' seep', ' up', ' over', ' the', ' sides', " it'll", ' help', ' it', ' um', ' kind', ' of', ' speed', ' it', ' up', ' so', ' um', ' once', ' you', ' get', ' the', ' water', ' boiling', ' it', ' really', " doesn't", ' take', ' a', ' whole', ' lot', ' of', ' time', ' and', ' i', ' can', ' even', ' tip', ' it', ' and', ' do', ' that', ' try', ' to', ' get', ' the', ' hot', ' wax', ' over', ' the', ' rest', ' of', ' it', ' and', ' make', ' it', ' melt', ' a', ' little', ' faster', ' it', ' only', ' takes', ' you', ' know', ' a', ' couple', ' minutes', ' to', ' get', ' them', ' melted', ' if', ' you', ' have', ' a', ' larger', ' pot', ' you', ' could', ' always', ' do', ' that', ' so', ' you', ' can', ' do', ' like', ' more', ' than', ' one', ' at', ' once', ' um', ' i', ' guess', ' i', ' could', ' have', ' done', ' that', ' but', ' my', ' hot', ' pads', " aren't", ' very', ' big', ' so', ' um', ' i', " don't", ' get', ' an', ' even', ' distribution', ' of', ' heat', ' if', ' i', ' do', ' that', ' so', ' hopefully', ' this', ' will', ' melt', ' quickly', ' but', ' um', ' anyway', ' well', " that's", ' doing', ' that', ' um', ' i', ' go', ' to', ' um', ' i', ' go', ' to', ' various', ' like', ' resale', ' stores', ' because', ' i', ' was', ' doing', ' candle', ' making', ' for', ' a', ' little', ' while', ' but', ' uh', ' it', ' turned', ' out', ' to', ' not', ' be', ' really', ' uh', ' profitable', ' to', ' do', ' so', ' um', ' now', ' i', ' use', ' a', ' lot', ' of', ' the', ' stuff', ' for', ' recycling', ' and', " i'll", ' go', ' find', ' things', ' you', ' know', ' people', ' have', ' dropped', ' off', ' at', ' resale', ' places', ' and', ' um', ' i', ' picked', ' containers', ' up', ' that', ' would', ' be', ' good', ' for', ' candles', ' these', ' are', ' excuse', ' me', ' ikea', ' cups', ' like', ' teacups', ' and', ' these', ' wicks', ' you', ' can', ' buy', ' them', ' at', ' pretty', ' any', ' pretty', ' much', ' any', ' craft', ' store', ' or', ' you', ' can', ' buy', ' them', ' online', ' you', ' can', ' do', ' one', ' of', ' a', ' couple', ' of', ' things', ' to', ' secure', ' the', ' wick', ' to', ' the', ' bottom', ' you', ' can', ' see', ' this', ' is', ' a', ' little', '

and', ' you', ' like', ' roll', ' that', ' between', ' your', ' fingers', ' and', ' stick', ' the', ' base', ' of', ' the', ' wick', ' to', ' the', ' bottom', ' and', ' let', ' it', ' dry', ' or', ' you', ' can', ' use', ' um', ' like', ' a', ' a', ' like', ' craft', " elmer's", ' makes', ' like', ' a', ' craft', ' uh', ' glue', ' that', ' you', ' can', ' use', ' with', ' ceramics', ' and', ' that', ' works', ' pretty', ' good', ' i', " haven't", ' had', ' any', ' trouble', ' with', ' that', ' either', ' so', ' um', ' i', ' find', ' all', ' these', ' different', ' containers', ' or', ' like', ' if', ' they', ' put', ' things', ' on', ' clearance', ' like', ' that', ' um', " i'll", ' use', ' those', ' kind', ' of', ' containers', ' this', ' was', ' actually', ' supposed', ' to', ' be', ' like', ' a', ' display', ' for', ' um', ' you', ' put', ' like', ' a', ' little', ' boutique', ' in', ' there', ' or', ' something', ' but', " i'm", ' actually', ' gonna', ' use', ' it', ' to', ' fill', ' it', ' up', ' so', ' it', ' looks', ' like', ' our', ' wax', ' is', ' pretty', ' much', ' getting', ' there', ' melted', ' wise', ' so', " i'm", ' at', ' like', ' seven', ' minutes', ' into', ' the', ' video', ' and', " i've", ' already', ' gotten', ' my', ' second', ' one', ' done', ' so', ' that', ' kind', ' of', ' gives', ' you', ' a', ' good', ' gauge', ' of', ' how', ' long', ' this', ' takes', ' per', ' you', ' know', ' per', ' uh', ' carton', ' i', ' guess', ' but', ' also', ' keep', ' in', ' mind', ' that', ' since', ' these', ' are', " there's", ' less', ' wax', ' in', ' these', " it's", ' going', ' to', ' take', ' a', ' lot', ' less', ' time', ' than', ' when', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' try', ' to', ' do', ' that', ' ski', ' lodge', ' one', ' for', ' math', ' and', ' body', ' works', ' so', " let's", ' uh', ' go', ' over', ' here', ' again', ' get', ' ready', ' for', ' our', ' second', ' pour', " i'm", ' gonna', ' move', ' the', ' knife', ' and', ' hopefully', " i'll", ' have', ' i', " won't", ' run', ' out', ' or', ' run', ' out', ' of', ' space', ' in', ' there', ' rather', ' again', ' try', ' to', ' go', ' as', ' evenly', ' as', ' possible', ' quickly', ' as', ' possible', ' voila', ' so', ' now', " that'll", ' probably', ' take', ' it', ' really', ' depends', ' on', ' how', ' long', ' it', ' takes', ' to', ' cool', ' with', ' a', ' smaller', ' container', ' like', ' this', " it'll", ' probably', ' take', ' a', ' couple', ' of', ' hours', ' for', ' it', ' to', ' really', ' solidify', ' but', ' i', ' would', ' recommend', ' um', ' just', ' kind', ' of', ' leaving', ' them', ' be', ' overnight', ' because', ' that', ' way', ' um', ' you', ' can', ' sort', ' of', ' ensure', ' that', " nothing's", ' gonna', ' be', ' accidentally', ' like', ' because', ' if', ' you', ' move', ' it', ' too', ' soon', ' or', ' do', ' anything', " you're", ' gonna', ' get', ' these', ' kind', ' of', ' like', ' little', ' divots', ' and', ' really', ' the', ' proper', ' way', " you're", ' supposed', ' to', ' do', ' it', ' is', " you're", ' supposed', ' to', ' like', ' save', ' a', ' little', ' bit', ' of', ' extra', ' wax', ' to', ' be', ' able', ' to', ' fill', ' kind', ' of', ' fill', ' that', ' in', ' but', ' um', " i'm", ' not', ' really', ' going', ' to', ' do', ' that', ' so', ' next', ' thing', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' do', ' and', " i'm", ' not', ' going', ' to', ' go', ' to', ' my', ' sink', ' and', ' exactly', ' show', ' you', ' but', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' take', ' while', " it's", ' still', ' kind', ' of', ' warm', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' run', ' some', ' cool', ' water', ' over', ' the', ' bottom', ' on', ' the', ' outside', ' so', ' i', ' can', ' stand', ' to', ' handle', ' it', ' and', ' then', ' um', ' while', ' the', ' inside', ' of', " it's", ' still', ' warm', ' it', ' makes', ' it', ' really', ' easy', ' to', ' get', ' these', ' tabs', ' off', ' so', ' i', ' can', ' kind', ' of', ' get', ' them', ' off', ' of', ' my', ' fingernail', ' or', ' i', ' can', ' take', ' like', ' a', ' butter', ' knife', ' or', ' something', ' and', ' pull', ' out', ' those', ' tabs', ' and', " i'm", ' going', ' to', ' wipe', ' out', ' the', ' inside', ' real', ' good', ' so', ' i', ' can', ' reuse', ' this', ' container', ' for', ' candles', ' or', ' i', ' can', ' reuse', ' it', ' for', ' storage', ' purposes', '

(" hey this is dr. mohan with dr. morgan and calm and as you get to know me you will learn that there are few things in life that I love more than a well brewed cup of coffee yeah I would even call myself a coffee snob mmm now with that said this video is gonna talk about coffee however not necessarily copy that we consume you see over the last 10 years I have been doing extensive research on coffee enemas coffee enemas caught my attention through what's called the Gershon Cancer protocol this is work that started back in the 1930s to help the body fight off cancer now I'll go over with you in other videos why copy items are so important what it boils down to is something called glutathione s transferase one dose of a copy enema increases your body's glutathione by six to seven hundred percent so let's talk through how to do a coffee enema now at first when i did the research on these I was kind of like really coffee goes where for how long I don't know however the more research I did and the more people that I talked to it became pretty evident to me that it was something that I needed to try and I'll be frank to the first couple times it was like I don't know what I think in this however after you do it for a while it's really it's not uncomfortable it's actually fairly relaxing and it's something hopefully for you like for me it's a part of your life I currently do about two to four animals per week to maintain my current health status you'll need two to three specific things the first thing that you'll need is specific coffee enema coffee rather this is coffee that is specifically brewed to be used in an enema I do not use the same copy that I drink in my enemas I do use a specific coffee brewed four enemas second thing that you'll need is an enema kit so this is a stainless steel reservoir and it comes with a couple different tips that you use for insertion and then finally we use just some form of lubrication for insertion of the tip I prefer coconut oil so how I get myself ready for a coffee enema and there's many ways to brew the coffee the way that I prefer brew the coffee is just in my French press so I choose a very coarse grind in my coffee blender and then what I do is I brew a normal cup of French press however I let the cop the coffee steep for at least 10 minutes because I want all the oils and tannins there as many as possible to be pulled out you then need to wait for that liquid to to cool to room temperature please do not do an enema with hot coffee you will literally burn your colon so you always want to test the water of your coffee before you do any insertion the simple way I do it is I just stick my finger in the water if it doesn't feel warm or cold to me that means it's room temperature now my French press will make about a quart of water now the amount of coffee that you use when you do the enema is really up to you my recommendation is start with not very much coffee you can work your way up to 3/4 to 1/2 of a quart per dose however the amount in my opinion isn't as important as the coffee just being in the presence of something called your colorectal vein is so it's actually called your hepato erectus from your liver into your colon so once the coffee is brewed and it's at room temperature I will then dump the coffee into the stainless steel container I will then take a small amount of this case of coconut oil and I will literally put that onto my rectum and this is used for lubrication on the tube there's actually a locking apparatus so once before you put the water and you will want to lock the apparatus so that once you pour the coffee and it will not pour out you will then what I normally do is I'll place a couple towels on the floor I'll actually recommend what you first start to do these to do them inside of a bathtub it's after you get doing it for a while it's not a messy thing however some people just have a little bit of peace of mind the first couple times they do these so I recommend you do it in a bathtub so you'll go ahead you'll then insert the tip of the enema into your anus and it will be inserted all the way to the tip what you'll then do is you'll lay on your right side you'll lay on your right side because we want the fluid your colon starts on your left side so we wanted to come up your descending colon and then drain through your transverse colon and even down into your ascending colon so that we can get as much of this into your colon as possible after you have completely emptied out the basin with coffee you will then slowly remove the tip from your bottom and you will then wipe your bottom side and the goal then is to keep the coffee in your colon for between like five minutes to maybe up to 30 minutes now your body will tell you when it's time to get rid of it you wanna be able to hold it as long as possible however there are no extra bonus points for being a superhero when it comes to this so when your body tells you it's time to void go ahead and do so over the toilet as though you're having at normal bowel movements wipe yourself up and something we'll choose to do a second enema after the first one because the first one in a lot of cases will get rid of a lot of the fecal material now in my opinion it's also best to do an enema after a bowel movement because we don't want to battle any fecal material that may be in your colon so give it a shot again do it in the tub the first couple of times and you will find is that your body's ability to detoxify have this very powerful antioxidant glutathione on hand this is one of the cheapest ways in the world to do so so any questions you might have send them to us at dr.

(" hi and welcome to Telstra Church my name is Joaquin Ostrom and I will prepare a nice scallop course for you I have already pre opened this fresh scallop you just carefully take them out of the their shells why this then you have to separate all the membranes from the main muscle like this and also this small side muscle and it's it's always a little bit chewy and you don't want to serve that like that it's one go stand next one - also we take care of the the road this so let's get rid of the plastic gloves and now it's actually just to sear them in quite hot pan with some butter and some some oil and to the scallop I will serve a Jerusalem artichoke puree very smooth you don't have to chew anything in this place together with reduced veal stock and the next ingredients or other belonging is egg yolk I just poached it to 63 degrees and put it through a sieve and then into a piping bag the egg yolk together with salt that's all you need actually and I will also serve Sally corn it's a slightly salt green plant really good goes well with with the scallop and the scallop I just fry it together with some bay leaf fresh thyme and some cloves of garlic okay that's good oops and since since it's really fresh fresh nice ingredients the yellow we just we don't have to try it they're not just very shortly we also have the some salt then we let it rest a little bit on the paper to get rid of all the excess tap this one are already done so now they can arrest for just a few minutes and why we are preparing the plate so this is not a really main course it's a well I consider its course in a warm warmth daughter with a within a nine course menu Jerusalem artichoke puree Oh go for some this small salty salad corn just very very small amount of the reduced Beanstalk that so the freshly seared scallop with all the belongings I think it's a well combined course and for sure so so far nobody has complained about this course so this is a nice modern Swedish course but that are highly appreciated so enjoy the course welcome", [' hi', ' and', ' welcome', ' to', ' Telstra', ' Church', ' my', ' name', ' is', ' Joaquin', ' Ostrom', ' and', ' I', ' will', ' prepare',

(" okay I wanted to throw together a quick video for you guys showing that I did finally get it to move I got the transmission working somewhat I still have some issues I didn't have when I made these videos I didn't have the steering hooked up so I had to get off and manually turn it around to to make it go but mainly this this is just to show that the transmission does work and that the the way I have the COG setup does move the vehicle which is basically what I was trying to to find out see how it worked what I'm going to end up doing is I do have the brakes hooked up now so that does help but I did end up with some problems so I still got to do some reworking with the transmission mainly the problem I'm having is it's like I'm sure a lot of you are aware that the belts started slipping and once they started heating up and slipping I just got worse and worse and finally when wouldn't move at all so if I had to do it again I would change the size of these pulleys I would make these pulleys instead these four inch card pulleys I would use probably eight inch pulleys something bigger where I have more surface area for the for the belts to hold on to what I'm going to do now though is I'm going to buy more of these pulleys I'm going to double these up so I'm gonna end up with two belts on each side and that should give me the attraction that I need now I also watched a couple of videos from tank man 101 that guy's brilliant he's an Australian and he makes tanks and one of his transmissions he uses belts also and what he does is he takes the belt and he bolts on a seat belt to keep it from stretching and so basically I'm going to use his idea but what I'm going to do is use a bicycle chain and I'm going to wrap it around the belt connect it and then bolt it through to the belt I'm using some small bolts and I'm going to I'm hoping that what this does is keep it from stretching I've I have to I'll use the seat belts but I have all this stuff on hand so I'm give it a try so I'm gonna bolt the chain through and that should help keep the belt from stretching and I think that's going to really help the problem with the slipping so we'll just have to see but you know it's trial and error this is one of the things that you know I found out and now I'm going to try to fix it see what we can come up with but I am slowly moving forward on the project and just stay tuned thanks for watching", [' okay', ' I', ' wanted', ' to', ' throw', ' together', ' a', ' quick', ' video', ' for', ' you', ' guys', ' showing', ' that', ' I', ' did', ' finally', ' get', ' it', ' to', '

(" hey guys in this video I'm going to be building the portable bandsaw table that you see here I wanted to make the table so that way I could quickly put the saw into it and quickly take it out so I could make cuts both in and out of the table without modifying the saw at all ok let's take a look at the build [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here's the portable bandsaw table all finished I clamp the saw op and I'm pleasantly surprised at how square the blade is to the table this is just with me just clamping the table right in with this mechanism and making sure the small table that's attached to the saw is flat against the bottom of the table and that's pretty much where it came in I'm not sure if you guys can see but Tom there's no movie magic here that's just exactly what happened when I clamped it up but um I was pleasantly surprised about that I'm not sure if you guys can see where the inspiration from this table came from it's just like a little itty bitty version of my welding table but maybe I'll make a small Welding cart put next to this small little table and just use it for little drops the funny thing is when I was building this I was using my belt grinder and I have a larger wood cutting bandsaw over here so I started thinking why not just put treadmill parts and wood cutting bandsaw so that way I can slow the speed down enough where I can cut metal with so that was just something I thought about when I was building this and maybe I will maybe it'll be a future project I'm really happy with how this came out and I plan on using this for a while and the good thing is is that it's not really custom the table isn't really custom made - this portable bandsaw so if I ever really need to replace the saw I can use the table with the saw because I feel like the clamping mechanism would be almost Universal maybe just a little adjustments here and there but it's something that I'll be able to use for a long time but anyway thanks for watching don't forget to hit that like button also don't forget to subscribe it really helps with wind in my cells when I'm making these videos so we'll see you next time", [' hey', ' guys', ' in', ' this', ' video', " I'm", ' going',

(" hi I'm marina from riding warehouse and this is gambler and today we're going to go over how to correctly size your horse for a bit when measuring your horse for a bit it is important to make sure you get the right size so there's a lot of commercial products on the market that allow you that are bit cisors you can use those or if you don't have that you can go ahead and use baling twine a stick a straw you can get really creative in whatever you think is safe to put in your horse's mouth to measure for a bit today I'm going to use a piece of wood that is thin enough the Gamboa is going to maybe think it's a bit already and have a really easy time just fitting that in his mouth whatever a measurement tool you're using you're going to want to mark one side before you stick it in your horse's mouth to indicate one side of the lip and then that way you'll just have to mark one other side as you pull it out you want to make sure if you are using a stick that it's nice and straight and then it's also free of anything that could harm your horse's mouth so this one is nice and smooth so Gambler shouldn't have too much trouble putting it as and smell we'll go ahead and ask him to open his mouth up sort of as if he was taking the bit there you go and once he stops kind of chewing around with it we'll go ahead and hold it where it should be we'll get the other side of his lip measurement and then we'll just kind of slowly drop it out and let them kind of easily slide it out you'll mark the spot that was on the other side of his mouth and this measurement will be the measurement that corresponds to the bit size that you do get keep in mind that if you're in between sizes for a bit it's typically recommended that you do go up to the next size is a bit that's a little bit too big is a little bit better than one that's too small if you have a bit that you know fits your horse and works well you can measure that to get your horse's current bit size you want to go ahead and make sure that the bit is laid out nice and flat and then measure from the inside to the inside so the inside of the ring to the inside of the ring this bit measures at about five inches if you have a bit that has more of a fixed cheek piece - like a shank bit or an egg but you want to do the exact same thing with this bit it has an ergonomic shape so it can't be laid out quite flat so we're going actually put it up on the bench and then we'll measure straight across you don't want to contour the tape measure to the bit so inside-to-inside and this bit measures just at about five inches as well keep in mind you're measuring the inside of the bit because that is the portion that will be in your horse's mouth keep in mind of the type of bit you are measuring for if you're using a loose ring you typically need to go up about a quarter size to ensure that there's no pinching if you're using a flat cheek or an egg butt or any kind of shank you're going to want to measure pretty exact to what your horse measures if you do have any questions or need further guidance please don't hesitate to contact us you can visit our website at riding warehouse.com", [' hi', " I'm", '

(" hello this is Christina coming to you from sunny California and my kitchen corner and today I would like to share with you how I make my ground vehicles it's dinner for tonight and stay tuned and I'll show you how I made it so what I'm going to use I'm going to use two pounds of ground beef and this is ground beef less than 22 percent fat and I'm gonna use half the packet of this Lawry's taco seasoning and it can of tomato sauce and some water okay so I added about a cup of water so that it will start cooking and I'm just gonna try to even it out I'll put the lid on and come back to it and maybe 20 minutes okay so it's been on medium heat or medium to low heat for about 15 minutes give or take so I'm just gonna do it now and I am gonna put half the packet of the taco mix okay and then one whole can of tomato pick up tomato sauce then you're gonna stir it and you're gonna let it do it though all the liquid evaporates and then I'll show you how to drain the grease from the meat okay so this is how it's gonna look and it's almost done and you should it still has a lot of liquid in there so just keep letting it evaporate and keep it on low and then I'll come back but I wish you could smell this and as you can see if you put the tomato sauce in it the little smoke and then you only need half of that packet of the taco seasoning okay so when it gets to this point what you're gonna wanna do is give it a big stir and by the way you'll be stirring maybe every five to ten minutes just so they won't get stuck but by the time it gets to this point what it's almost cooked what I do is I just turn it off and then I put all the meat to one side like that and then I just put it all up here then I live it they're tearing some paper towels and I just let it soak up and if you don't use paper towels I guess you can use a strainer in order to strain the the grease but I don't like to wash the strainer with all this grease so this is what I I would rather do Plus this way it's easier to dispose your hand I don't want to throw it down the drain so this is this is better for me I'll rather invest in some paper towels then invest in a plumber okay and once it's all soaked up then you're ready to make your tacos okay so this is how it looks after I drained it and it's warming up again because I'm gonna start making the tacos half of my family has already eaten and I'm just gonna make my cockles right now and this was the grease that was let go this one in another one but just to let you see and it's easier to dispose of the grease doing it this way so okay there you go so I'm just gonna put it in the bowl just to make it easier to assemble okay these are some of the tacos that I made half my family has already eaten so I'm just gonna make my tacos now so I just fill it up with the me and then I like to put the cheese in on the bottom and then I'm going to put some onions I don't care for tomato but I'm just gonna put a little bit in there and then the cilantro then I'm put it down and just so if you have tacos yet or but have broken up already that's fine I'm gonna show you how you can um eat those actually I prefer them like this you just put it on top and then you see them through so you just kind of put this stuff you want to eat and again I'm just gonna put a little bit of tomato and the cheese ice so I sliced up some lettuce and I put it in water so that it doesn't turn brown but I want my tacos with cabbage so this is how I'm gonna serve my tacos in fact I'm just gonna use all the cabbage because my kids don't like their tacos with cabbage and then I'm gonna put the the sour cream and then chili here are two options one if the taco shell has broken and you can eat your tacos this way or the traditional way so hope you enjoyed this video and let me know if you tried try making your own tackles bye", [' hello', ' this', ' is', ' Christina', ' coming', ' to', ' you', ' from', ' sunny', ' California', ' and', ' my', '

(" hi it's Monica today I'm going to show you how easy it is to shape with Guatemalan palm Lee Pat I'll be using a palm leaf hat that I got from somebody hats and somebody is based here in Houston I got an open crown hat by open crown I mean an unshaped hat it'll be a four inch brim and I'll show you that all you have to do is just get it wet I'll shape it into a classic cattle increase for you and I will also shape the brim and after that if there is any other crease that you're interested in learning just post a comment and then I'll show you how to make the next crease thanks we're over the sink and I have my hat this is a orange brown some body fat and you can see the name there's the name bottom on we're going to close so you can see so and I'm in the kitchen sink and I'm about to get it wet run in the water and I get the all hot wet and as you can see I'm not submerging the hat making sure the Hat is keep it wet so if I wanted to I could have filled the sink with water and just dumped it into the sink but I don't have I don't have to do that so now we're in the sink what I'm going to do this is the front of the hat here this is the back and I'm going to press on both sides press it in so you can see it's forming shape and I'm just tilting it a little bit so that I can see how it's coming out in the front but squeeze it in on the sides each side and you're going to want to make sure it's even so you can see that's fairly even in front and then we're going to press the center in press it down don't be afraid of it because if it's not wet enough you can always get it wet again or if you make a mistake you can correct it while it's wet so there's the crown I'm just going to turn it towards me so that I can see if it's even okay so that is the front and now for the brim if you get the Hat and it arrives kind of bent you can straighten out the room if you want but basically what you're going to do is curl the sides up you want to use your hand kind of cup it and curl it if you want to bring the front down and use your thumbs and I'm just scrolling up the sides and I'm kind of over curling it because as you can see when I release it it tends to spring back so as it dries I want to make sure that it stays where I'm creasing it so I'm kind of over creasing it so you can see that side then I'm just going to turn it around so that I can shape the other side and I've given it a firm touch as you can see it's coming along and now there's a big space in between here and here so I'm going to turn it towards me just that I can close that in some more so I'm just kind of bringing it in a little bit more in the front I'll try and do it from this angle so you can see a little bit better so I've closed it in and then the hat is starting to dry on me but that's pretty much it you can tilt the front down if you want then turn it around so I can tilt the back down a little bit but that's pretty much it it's fairly easy to do but that is the cattlemen crease and I'm just going to turn it towards me one more time because it looks a little off-center by looking at it in the camera give me just a second but that's pretty much it you just use your hand you kind of cup cup the brim and squeeze and I'm just hope my other hand on the sweat band my fingers are on the sweat band and just cupping it in like that and I'm holding it from the crown of the hat so that you can see but I'm just holding the Hat from the underside and cupping the brim of the Hat with my hand so that is it there's the cowboy hat now if you're wanting to do something a little bit more aggressive on the sides like a taco crease then what you want to do is you want to curl the back up more and by that I'm kind of pressing down with my thumb put the coral in return once you can see kind of giving it more of a curl because the taco crease tends to start like right in here in this area so you have to give it a really good curl and then I'm giving it a good pinch and this is going to require two hands because the taco crease is pretty sharp on the sides and you can see what I'm doing and I'm pinching the corners then I'll do the same on this side I'm going to give it a pinch now I'm doing is pressing or putting a crease in here real firm one so that you can see what it looks like tends to have more of a swoop to it maybe backs you up see so you can see that side this side still needs to come in some more it's trying to come undone then okay and then I just brought the brim down a little bit more in the back because it tends to want to crawl a little bit and that noise you hear in the background is my two-year-old lion but that is what it would look like and let you see and some people like it to come up higher on the sides but either way that's how you get it done okay so here is the shaped at mix it from the side in the back can put this shape and here's where some people will add the finishing touches and put it on your head and if you see any flaws or let's say you want the brim to come down lower then I'm just grabbing a hold of the hat so it doesn't move on my head and just pull it down and I'm trying to get the curl to start from this far back and bring it down so I'm using my thumb to kind of help me create a curl so as you can see it came down a little bit more in front so before it showed more of my forehead and now it's curl more but that's pretty much it this is a four inch brim cattlemen crease watermelon palm hat", [' hi', " it's", ' Monica', ' today', " I'm", ' going', ' to', ' show', ' you', ' how', ' easy', ' it', '

(" hey there's no calling here how to prep leather to burnish now if you don't know what burnish is it's the process of taking a piece of leather that's a little bit rough on the edge and then you go back and forth with the tool something like this and it kind of burnished it smoothes it out a little bit our best bet is to take a piece of sponge like this and you get it wet and reach it over here to some water you don't want to soak it all you want to do is get this moist and you go down along that edge and get some moisture to it so that it goes in now you can see maybe you can see it that there's a little bit of discoloration that's occurred on that edge now I've done that and i've got that wet matter of fact I'll just go a bit further here because this is a piece of scrap wood you can see now how that leather is turned out no you don't want to try and burnish the leather with one of these or you could actually use an antler that's what I use a lot of times you don't want to burnish it until it's dried back a little bit because what happened is the moisture is went inside the leather and what I want is I want the surface to be just if you want to call it just a tiny bit tacky but not really so you can see it's starting to dry already there's the moisture it was down a little bit further and it's starting to go up further now I'm getting close to that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you so we don't waste a lot of time put the video take the tool and I start going over now I just did a little bit there and if you can look you can probably see that it's smooth a little bit now I'm not doing anything on the back I just doing it on the front so I take this a night Bernie [ __ ] back and forth and I move that's really fast I'm using this is just a nylon tool which you can buy online or you can buy a leather store probably and I go back and forth on this and this is what we call burnishing so the edge comes out a whole lot smoother now a lot of times if I'm dyeing the leather I will dye the leather and burnisher right after I put the dye on because the thigh usually have despite we got some oils in it but it also usually has alcohol and they usually thrive fairly fast or some form of something that's going to cause it to accelerate and then I'll do the same thing and I don't have to put some moisture on in this case the leather was plain and I put it in no I could use this antler and it does the same thing I had a friend give me this does he collect something goes out there that's for the antlers and it comes along it does exactly the same thing now as you can see I've burnt East that smooth off and you can see because of the moisture it pushes this down just a little bit it sounds like I'm saying I'm right close to the Snake River and you can probably hear and that's that's one of those high speed either fight boats or whatever they've got two or three jets that go out here you don't hear that bicker or you just hear a big pushes a little things called by matter of fact on my channel I got a one of my channels I've got a picture one of them going by and he was only going about three-quarters of a mile 3/4 speed I think it was checking it out for some problems and it was still low but and probably 85 90 miles an hour so anyway this is about the burnishing hope this has been helpful a little bit of moisture you can see I don't know if it'll reflect or not but there's a little bit of reflection that's starting off of that from my burnishing on it and and that's what you want when so prepping it little bit of water you could use right after you do the dine either way hey I hope that's been helpful and you take care and have a great day bye now", [' hey', " there's", ' no', ' calling', ' here', ' how', ' to', ' prep', '

(" i'm going to show you how you can lay a concrete pad now these can be used for driveways or paths but the one we're laying today is for a shed first you have to decide where your shed's going to sit you need to allow enough distance from hedges or fences now the shed i'm going to build is 1.8 by 1.5 this timber will be the boxing for our concrete pad i've already pre-cut my timber to length i'm using 100 by 25 rough sawn untreated timber i'm now going to nail the boxing together i'm using 75mm nails just leave your nails sticking out a little way when we take the boxing off it's going to make it nice and easy now i'm just going to make sure that our boxing is nice and square to do this i'm just going to measure the diagonals and ensure both ways are exactly the same dimension 2472 spot on next thing you want to do is dazzle around the outside edge of your boxing our concrete pad requires 75 millimeters of compacted base coarse underneath 75 millimeters of concrete there are different depths of pads for different jobs check mitre10's online guide for the correct pad for your project now the pad can be level with the ground or raised above it we want our concrete pad level with the ground so this means we need to remove 150 millimeters of soil to allow for the compacted base coarse and concrete the boxing is pegged in place sure the boxing is level so the shed sits flat then fix the pegs to the boxing and then just rake and remove any loose dirt because our concrete pad is for a shed we've decided to put in a rebate this is for the walls of the shed to slot onto right now we can put in our base course and this is your chance to hire a compactor they're really easy to use next we add a layer of sand and then we're going to give it a rake the sand will fill in the holes in the base course making a nice smooth surface now it's time for the polythene make sure you tuck it in neatly a pad this size doesn't really need mesh but i'm going to add it anyway just to show you how it's done we're using little concrete blocks to hold the mesh off the polythene so it sits in the middle of the concrete slab time for the main event mix your concrete and a mixer according to the instructions and then pour it into the boxing i've tapped the boxing to settle the concrete and get the air bubbles out for the first stage of the finishing process i'm using this formal one to screed it off next we're going to use the magnesium trowel this stops drawing the water up and out of the concrete and finally a steel trowel to give us a nice smooth finish wait between one to two hours and then repeat this final step for an even smoother finish now we just need to wait for the concrete to cure keep an eye on it concrete that dries too fast can crack or shrink so you may want to give it a light spray with the hose in sunny conditions for something this size you'll need to leave it for around 48 hours right now it's time to take our boxing off first thing you want to do just give the boxing a light tap this will make it easier to remove take our screws out of the pegs now we'll just pull our nails out of the boxing that we left sticking out and just very gently lift that up and there's our finished pad with rebate ready for our shed to fit onto easy as for all the help and advice you need to get the job done just head down to mitre 10.", [" i'm", ' going', '

(" one go g'day guys now I'm going to show you how to clean some nine bolt truck they don't make these currently anymore they're you getting the plastic track for the power function battery drains now the way I clean these tracks is I get these rubbers now you can get them at your local corner store news agency or craft Center but I'm I'm not a big fan of using sandpaper when it comes to cleaning metal often because I find it would scratch and wear it out now that's especially what happened to you in Australia gets the humidity yeah anyway make sure you clean the top obviously everyone thinks oh yeah that's fine also when you clean the inside make sure you do clean the inside because the actual flange of the train itself is where it actually picks up electricity and then actual topper where it goes on top of the rail is actually just the rubber foregrip so please make sure you clean the inside so you make sure the tank is a good who's even electricity flow speaking of which also the outside rail because that's where your quarters from the controller so your power cable to the track because if it's not clean it's always going to short-circuit somewhere in the track so make sure the outside is also clean and speaking of short-circuits clean the connection parts because if the connections not clean between the two tracks you're going to definitely going to get a short-circuit so make sure you clean them now I clean the outside top and inside and the connection points I've like all my tracks especially with the curve but seen with the crushed track in the actual switching points himself with the points especially I didn't actually bother cleaning the outside of the rail because I don't use the power cord the I always use it on a straight or curved track and the same with this cross track I don't even use a power cord on that so I didn't actually didn't bother doing the UM outside the rail main reason is this is time consuming because I make sure it's a good job to make sure it's clean so the Train can run properly it's yeah it's basic time consuming so that did save me a couple of hours cleaning because I have quite a few track so whatever works for you but the main thing you got to make sure you clean is the inside top and the connection that's the main point and whichever track you're going to use for the power cord make sure it's clean pretty much that's it I'm also one thing with the actual rubber itself if we find it gets dirty this is the only time I actually would use sandpaper let's say for example I will clean this track here so not so not clean yet now you can obviously and see now there's a difference between the clean and not so clean same for this show straight clean not clean now with the rubber itself it's going to get filthy so when you get this won't actually get much darker than that so like black so when it goes like that I don't want to be smearing it on to the track cause it's not going to properly clean so this is when I get the sandpaper in and actually properly clean it so once you do that it's back is almost brand new and therefore it's going to eventually wear out like I make sure I get my good use wear out of it but when it gets to this size it's going to be very handy and actually cleaning the actual arm points itself it can help because if you using the foam lips and start it's not going to clean the guide for the flange when it knocks the point there so when it gets to this size you can actually get in the groove and actually clean the inside of the rail also where they are lever for where the track moves for the point itself and also there so that comes in handy so and you can also if you don't have in a bad size yet because you can also shape it with the sandpaper to access the very types corners but other than that that's how I clean the track thank you guys for watching that video I hope that was helpful for you playing your own 9-volt Lego train

(" hi i'm holly silva and i've been a crafts expert for 15 years today i'm going to show you how to make a lollipop scarecrow craft now here as you can see i took a lollipop and attached a popsicle stick to the end of it with some craft wire now the cool thing about craft wire is it's like duct tape you can attach pretty much anything with it and it stays just secure it with a little bit of double stick tape if you need to avoid any like slipping and it it stays pretty well so here i also have a couple of pieces of clothing that i cut out out of some scratch construction paper brown of course because you know he's in the field and i cut out a shirt and a couple of a couple of pant legs for him now what we're going to do is we're going to grab some yellow tissue paper and put it over the top of his head first we're going to grab some double stick tape and just place it over the top of his head like so and then we're going to put the tissue paper over the top also like so now grab it around the neck and grab another piece of craft wire here and wrap one side over and wrap the other side over other end rather secure them nice and tightly now if a little bit of the paper comes out it's okay because you want it to have that kind of fluffy look now set the body over the clothing body we have and go right down the middle with some double stick tape and attach double stick tape to the other sides too that way it can close like a sandwich over his body and the pant legs as well and add some more double stick tape to attach in there and draw a cool little face on him maybe add some googly eyes if you need and there you have it a lollipop scarecrow craft happy holidays see you everyone", [' hi', " i'm", ' holly', ' silva', ' and', " i've", ' been', ' a', ' crafts', '
