shaking beef which is actually called  fall low flat and let's get started  these are the ingredients that you'll  need for this recipe you can find the  full list of ingredients on my website  at the blooming foodie calm first mins 3  garlic cloves so you put your book 2  tablespoons correct and that's all  Easter shush ok next is the fish sauce 1  tablespoon 1 tablespoon divulge it's no  matter what looking show there's more  folks who do next add in 1 tablespoon of  soy sauce I like it a little spicy so I  add in 1 teaspoon of sriracha and 1  teaspoon of crushed red pepper but these  are completely optional to add a bit of  sweetness to the marinade add in 2  tablespoons of sugar to balance out the  salty and the sweet add in 1 teaspoon of  vinegar and mix well use about 1/2 1/2  pounds of your favorite cut of steak and  cube them in 1-inch pieces I like to use  ribeye  toss the cube steak into the marinade  and marinate for at least one hour  for the super simple vinaigrette you'll  need 1/2 cup of vinegar with one and a  half tablespoons of sugar mixed with a  half tablespoon of salt and you just mix  that together and it's really that  simple  use half of the vinaigrette to pickle  half of a red onion slice the other half  of the vinaigrette will be used to dress  the salad which I'll show you a little  bit later for the salad you'll just need  some mixed greens and maybe about 2  small Tomatoes after the steak is  marinated heat up a small amount of oil  in the pan or preferably a wok on high  heat  once the oil begins to smoke cook the  steak and the marinade  be sure to flip the beef or shake the  pan to brown all sides of the steak  you'll know your steak is finished  cooking when the sauce begins to  caramelize  use the remainder of the vinaigrette to  dress the salad  you  serve the steak on top of the dress  salad and top the salad off with the  pickled red onions  I had some leftover vinaigrette so I  chopped off the entire dish with some  more vinaigrette but this is completely  optional finish the dish off with some  freshly ground black pepper and that's  it  all right time to dig in oh my god look  at this carmelization that we got on the  meat mmm  meet Toby  hmm that's good  Osgood Osgood for the full recipe please  visit my blog at the blooming foodie  calm if you liked this video please  thumbs up and subscribe

fight a mix of  2250 and hell I just this is a direct  continuation from part one if anyone  hasn't seen that feel free to do so you  can see how we have the playing so far  and anywhere any kind of specific Reed's  that you have any of the players here  will of all been garnered in part one so  if you want to check that out feel free  to do so but they will of course be  standalone episodes so there's no  obligation to do that at a station  offsuit on the top right table we're  happy to bring this in for an open we  got three about unfortunately we're  gonna have to let this go  it sucks here cuz this guy he's a half  stocker and he's just kind of calling  and then calling again he's almost  certainly gonna be one of the weaker  players so we definitely want to get  involved with pots against him we have a  queen out of the small blind we're gonna  be three betting Don Lemon he's been one  of the more aggressive players so far  this session so we have potentially  gonna be going to war if we three bet  any for bets it's not really an that I'm  planning on folding kbits we don't  really have any read up we have the no  pair we're gonna start this off with a  check out of check Cole pretty difficult  board until connected that's strongly  with a turn we take the need against his  9x we're afraid of king X obviously and  now we are afraid of 10x  don't envision waves folding here will  see his son will see a sizing if he  doesn't like to bash I don't think we're  applying unfolding I mean I think I was  particularly enormous wheedle considers  but I mean if it does go enormous it  just curve looks as somewhat bloody so I  think we were we're planning on calling  down there versus most size and he did  in fact half the night so we got a  little look six Jack offsuit people let  go and okay suited on the button it's  reasonably playable this guy he's got  some chips he might feel a little bit  more frivolous than you might normally  would so we're happy to see pots in  position against him see if we can make  a strong hand and look to play a big  part definite borderline call sucks that  we got to squeeze behind we're not  getting the worst of prices whoops I  said I called the call of a single raise  is my limit here at the king in suit it  was margin the best year for facing the  three bet I think we're just gonna let  it go  I wanna get four bet it's obviously very  even more trivial will open the pocket  threes though on the top right table we  take down the blinds a seven no good  nine straight off of it  potential pop ruin here in the a  sideboard when it goes three way and you  see bets no just bet fold fold no action  five Jack in the big blind of soup not  much we're gonna be able to do here  forget a walk that would be fantastic  hey six suited we will bring this in for  an open definitely don't mind us take  another blinds here we see a flop  well fired a single at least one bet  here in this flop with the potential to  fire on multiple violence we do not have  to that Queen would have been a card I'd  be bargaining for sure and King trial  suits we will fill ace deuce is gonna be  good enough to open for the cutoff uh  ten three on the bottom right table we  will just be letting this one go even  face the minute open like obvious we're  getting a very good price so it's  obviously you're completely trashy and  ace queen of the small almost certainly  gonna be playing this one  okay tapas this guy just let calls which  is the sign indicative of a weaker  player it's pretty unlikely he is one of  the better players for sure when he's  just name calling there because he was  just like you I'm calling on the button  as well which is just something you  should just you should never do it's I  mean if you've got a hand that's good  enough to play just bring it in for a  race there's so much inherent value in  just taking down the blinds even if you  even if you have like even if you're  trapping with allegations or something  like that there's just so much inherent  value not allowing your opponent to see  your free flop and you just just a good  standard obviously never never open them  not alone with this ten at all this  sizing is kind of tilting  all right Bufo old youth old oops too  many by rivers for us if we do billions  like it obviously we don't look the best  time there very often anyway there's  just not that many good cards first on  the river take Queen we will let go also  we well the seven six potential action  border but the top left table obviously  a lot of potential to strong hands  possible there but no no significant  action going it 7:6 offsuit open the top  left table not read much we're going to  be able to do here if this goes multi  way we will consider seeing a flop it's  still gonna be close this guy calls me  definitely called I guess so I guess  we're calling either way bush life here  being at a position just looks hard and  this fact three bets that makes it much  easier decision for us and the six seven  over here when it's not a multi-way posh  we just let it go  obviously it's a button open so it's a  bit of a weak arrange all range but it's  still gonna be very very tricky to turn  a profit there okay pocket fives easy  open blind versus blind take down the  blinds no harm no fell okay we're gonna  call and take flop here although  squeezing is actually quite attractive  let's go for the squeeze instead  so not shocked this guy calls but this  is the guy I mean this has happened at  once already where he's just gonna call  and just give it up easily on the flop  so let's hope he does it again we're  gonna see we're gonna fire one and done  here and a lot of words and obviously we  can potentially just hit a sneaky-ass  strong hand as well not in love with  life that this guy is stuck arranged  we are gonna bet this board though I had  no reason to go particularly larger I  think this will get the job done for the  most parts and we have a sneaky very  strong I'm gonna the top right table I  was gonna go all-in and hope he has the  tent never take down the bottom right  table which we love actually checking  here might have been better cuz he  always bets it ends right and he might  blow yeah check checking that was those  a mistake checking would be better there  cuz he never checks back to straight and  if we do check and he has like for  example with diamonds is it's entirely  possible that he that he elects for a  bluff so we want to give him that  opportunity so that that all-in was bad  actually that was that I didn't I didn't  think through my options there it's  amazing like hey I mean like a you know  take millions of hands of Poker but  still like just just little small  setback just take an extra like three or  four seconds of things for your options  it can make a huge difference to your  winners like obviously those kind of  situations they don't come up all that  often but if you play them just a little  bit better every single time it does  make it it adds up but it makes a pretty  big difference so I'm annoyed at myself  that hey these things happened we're not  gonna it's not gonna be the first  mistake I'll make it's not gonna be the  last sorry it's not the first mistake  should I say I certainly won't be the  last  that's nice 7 suited one got rid the  coat off we're happy to bring in for an  open  we take it down I King Jack will be  going for the open again I rested under  the golden arches like this we'll go  yeah we can't consider three betting  here but folding versus month ago to  open seems reasonably prudent as well 10  Jack suited in the bottom-left table we  shall bring it in and we got three bets  here we will see the flop here he's made  quite small I'm getting over 2 2 1 our  money and we have a hand that has the  potential to flop quite well and we get  to go multi-way so that's added gravy  okay we would like if there's at least  one Spade here but we have the open  ender so that's pretty good we're  getting an exceptionally good price here  so we will certainly be seeing a turn  so our options here now are to go for  the check or we can also lead we are  going to go for the check  I'm gonna go for the big over right here  and expected to fold a nice pretty often  we just wrap a flow here so hard  Oh whoops heinous the top to burrow but  honestly I would have expect he seems  like a more of a rakish player so I  wouldn't expect him to throw those types  of hands books cuz it's kinda it's just  how it's hard for us to have that many  gloves there so when the over back we  just incredibly noted but obviously he  has the Queen blocker which is quite  good for him like he blocks our full  heads and stuff like that as well but we  can definitely be playing we can  definitely have solutions that take that  line so I think if he I was like hey  Stan he's jack stuff like that he almost  certainly folds the ace queen is  probably just a little bit too strong  but hey no harm no foul who loses think  that was a 30 euro bash plus whatever so  we use like 35 40 you're almost to buy  in but not the end of the world  that's probably put us down for this  session  yeah we're certainly down a little bit  for the session I was hopefully maybe  had to get it back before we kick back  off the King 10 we will be going for the  open up on the top right tail we're  gonna call with the fives after we take  it down to content will be open to a 7 I  bet the board for pocket fives or some  enough fold into a single that we pick  up and open under to go along with our  pair sure bad about you will call it  again thanks pretty good it should  really shut him down I feel like if he  does I had like tens Jack's queens  anything like that it should really  showed him down here so if we triple  borrows I will be suspicious I'll be  suspicious to say the least  he does slow down which is I mean if he  if he'd bet big there I don't know we  would have been a tricky spot I don't  think we were planning on folding I had  we decided to peel one off here with no  hair and the good shot to the notice  when we even the kindest it seems kind  of reductive for me do flush we hit our  ace with that what he just bets  absolutely massive there on the diamond  it's just it's just a spot where it's  really hard for us to be ahead it's kind  of hard for him to have that many gloves  against the designed here like he bet  this flop and then he just bonds  eternity bombs it absolutely enormous as  well so he's just he's just committed  himself and I just don't envision him  doing that with like you know if he is a  king queen or something like that maybe  first king queen isn't the queen of  diamond that the king of king or queen  of diamonds or something to that effect  it's possible but overall they expect us  to be in trouble there quite frequently  and it's really hard from the out like a  stone cold Bluff there so just letting  her hand go seems more prudent to Levin  and not okay we peels this turn every  second people a flop brother I'm just  gonna bet quite small here just we're  just gonna protect around a little bit  because look that value for my case X  that I picked up a good show zone it was  like a nice tanner something like that  there's a pretty decent shot see calls  with overs and a good shush  and qui 10 we just let this little girl  nine five on the button not much you're  going to be able to do nine six suited  in the big blind over the top left table  as definitely some potential will defend  here ideally we'd like to see this go  multi way if it doesn't we'll just let  it go  they don't fall suited cards is that  often versus number two gone open though  who's got that little bit of a stronger  range it's fine as I said if that goes  multi way we're definitely we're  definitely peeling and taking a flop in  a position or no King seminar super yet  tonight go at deuce three we're not  gonna be doing anything here other than  folding pocket kings let's see if we can  get a little pot Brown here I can clean  up in the top left table definitely  wouldn't mind a little bit of action  here either I'll go for the three but  here in the bottom obviously we want to  see player four bring in a large squeeze  which doesn't do K board obviously sets  our concern and you know has like eight  nine but overall not the worst of words  but any stretch the imagination  not a boy word forever gonna be all that  comfortable like we get if we bet you  get raised here we're kind of sad but  there are a decent number of hands that  kind of definitely just call which is  what we want don't mind seeing this at  all  we've got a full house down in the  bottom right table obviously one of the  weaker phil has is a weaker possible to  flop we're pretty much just some jet  come out here for the most part I had  the five we like a lot there's one  written to e3 potentially take this down  and fold them off at shop with like a  really large over it  this guy bets quite large which is  annoying as hell I'm not a fan I've just  called him for jumps no I had this jack  I mean it's good and bad so you can have  ten Jack which is good he could have  like a nine Jack as well which is bad  oh no inquiry we're just gonna we're  just gonna ship it in if he has a hand  looking call he's gonna call most  sizings we're not playing I've told him  if he bets himself so might as well look  to punish him as much as possible the  only thing going for smaller size in  there would be if he has I'm the case in  nine maybe he calls a smaller size but  overall I'm I prefer just going from  it's fine election weekend weekend  occasionally I hear up there my second  parents don't like that anyway so we're  not automatically giving up the pot if  he just says like ace nine and stuff  like that and as I said ten Jack will  make up a reasonable part of his range  there when he calls to streets having  the open ended with overs so we want to  make sure we punish him when he has  River duck top parrot I panic  obviously sucks if he has a hand like to  pair like nine Jack or something like  that that gets there in the river but as  I said if if he has that we're gonna be  using a large bet anyway if we check or  if we bet small and he jams like we're  never folding anyway and I presume any  jams all those two pairs pluses if we do  bet smaller so it doesn't really change  too much the ACE for we like to go on  the bottom due to the air in a position  open by eight  a queen under the gun obviously no good  neither is the deuce 4 4 7 8 Oh suit in  the cutoff we're not planning on  bringing that in a full suit we  obviously open - Brooks offsuit variety  we're happy just to let it go  a stray in the big blind we shall see  how the action develops there are some  scenarios where we like to play this  might use it was a three that Bluff here  if the blunt goes for the open which he  does your 5 has already gone for the 3  met those so I guess we let these guys  battle it out  looks like we're about to see a flop  here at the for 5o suit oh that would  have been a pretty decent flop for us I  was sneaky without a man it would have  been extremely undisguised  okay ace Jack pretty strong attention to  play and let's see take a flop here at  the 45 a flat bottom pair with depending  on the sizing we make sure : Street  that's a really bad turn for a really  bad turn not a huge fan of cold calling  three bets here but given this guy is  propensity to call and see well to it  like see see flops like that I expect us  cultivate really frequently and I'm okay  I mean it's it's not like an amazing  scenario but taking a check is fine  where this guy seems to be on the  slightly more aggressive side you've  seen him three about a few hands now and  so it's like it's not like he's just  kind of limited to not at hands it's  just a case now or they want to make a  play at this board I think I do so let's  make it four ready to go this is very  much just a one and done bet unless we  manage to beat that ace that you don't  okay but on my table we have picked up  top two pair there is a potential flush  neither we just fell liked our opponent  obviously what's referred to get more  action there it's not the word where I'm  ever gonna be still playing really  though I'm happy just to go ahead and  bet okay nine ten suited we are going to  flat Co this is the same flare that we  run our large bluff on earlier on so  there are some scenarios where we can  over bet quite liberty for value and  expect to get called a bit lighter  unfortunately but work does not allow us  to see the flop so we aren't going to  have two folds face jutsu is an art size  although we are a reason big deep  wouldn't have been obscene to cold take  a block there but I'd be pretty  surprised if returning a profit by doing  so and one of the worst flops imaginable  for the pocket raise we just let this  will go there are some boards where we  will continue without hitting our set  but the basic aim for ain't one of them  okay coming ten sue down the bottom left  table let's see if we can see a  multi-way flop which you can flap top  pair okay kicker far from a disaster  please spots the where our kicker isn't  reading all that red ons because it's  pretty unlikely they've got like that  many Queen I or Queen eight or worse  okay I'm just gonna wait you're here now  and probably bet most rivers to gonna  get value from like pocket jacks pocket  eights pocket tens but also we block it  that cut those types of hands we get one  fold dart Elaine because he checked back  this flop were not really afraid of any  I got on the vision I'm ever checking  back a better Queen and I don't really  envision him still playing sets or  anything like that that board and I'm  will tear apart either so when this  Joe's checked through I expect that the  best time there the Queen Amina  frequently and you know our hands  there's way more bad cards than good  cards for hands there's no real there's  no value really and in not betting  they're just allow two opponents of free  opportunity to catch up Bay City okay we  flop the toughest of the pair's what's  the toughest of the kicker's up on the  top right table and fortunately now  actually know obviously aboard we were  really hoping to get paid  I'm you married looking to get stocks it  or anything like it's pretty difficult  to get you know a single parent for  stocks in a single raise partly a hinge  boat we were gonna be looking for  multiple streets of body obviously okay  queen eight blind versus blind when we  do not fold we flop a second pair live  up to bear obviously the two pair isn't  all that great and we improved to better  two-parent we have three paradigm wears  been a cold in here he has the a side of  the king nice hand sir nice hand I don't  think we can really do too much  different there we're getting two to one  with the Queen eight blind versus blind  versus a very wide range so Queen H is  going to be doing well enough to hold  getting such a good price when we've got  the pair they're on the ACA sex George  we you know we can't fall to a single  bet for sure  turn betting turn would have been a  mistake and then river I mean I don't  think we can ever fill my reader so  happy with how it played it all right  and at least nine we opened up in the  top right to Queen four in the bottom  left we let go Don Lemon has been  getting at the better it was so far this  session all of Oliver we were doing  quite well all of our profit has been  going that way move around the big  bluefin him over at the bottom left  table earlier on where he had East the  Queen and we had the Miss straight row  and he's been definitely getting the  better of us I've never find a saying  which they may not asleep it click the  ten Jack had was you know necessarily  necessarily Bluff I always hate that  term though where there's something is  necessary and I felt to be profitable  I still do feeling to be profitable I  mean without the Queen without blocking  that those extra full houses I know how  to be surprised if he calls there were  just a lonely spot maybe it does I mean  Ice Queen isn't all that different like  the hands I'm wrapping ace Queen who's  doing a justice like if you were of them  a favor play Queens that way but  I think I think he can fold a nice there  pretty frequently so I'm okay with it  okay we're gonna go for the three but  here this guy has been reasonably active  so far so we're obviously wrapping quite  strong here with this kind of hand but  3-betting it from under the gun plus 1  we get the respect we deserve all right  we have open to the a stray we flap top  hair with the backdoor flush draw  bedding here it doesn't really  accomplish too much it loves the posh  which we're not really a fan of doing in  this with this kind of kind of type of  hand strength and purely because it's  you know if we do better if we better  and get cold we're against essentially  flush draws or battery sex primarily so  when we check more fun things could  happen we can we can induce some Bluffs  so he is like you know king queen here  something like that he might just elect  to stab and I guess we're just gonna  check hold here again betting for value  seems incredibly optimistic like I don't  imagine a pad like a so here at King  Knight get 10 9  Jack Knight anything that calls his  pocket queens because I mean maybe if  maybe that exact time calls perhaps I'm  kind of surprised you didn't three bet  that free that seems bad feel like he  should absolutely be three betting that  hand as six nine soon if this guy is  essentially been open so we're starting  off folding we're not in love with this  Queen but we don't hate it  enough that we're just going to check  fold so we are going to call and see a  river the jack we don't like either a  few bets again we let this one go  I didn't want to see a diamond that we  didn't want to see a Broadway card  pretty kits there we call that River but  I'm pretty sure he did cope quite large  but I still still think we're gonna make  that call and the jack though there's  just some extra cards although maybe  he's not really gonna be betting us  Jack's there so maybe I'm maybe only  correct in saying that but overall I  think letting letting the third pair go  they're facing a large river bed it's  going to be absolutely fine we have been  spewing a little bit of chips here on  this table you might need to tighten up  a little bit  we've only got like four or five more  minutes left to go so let's see if we  can think ourselves at decent pot and  again ourselves a day say where we're  down somewhere in the ballpark of 20  euro ish since we started this so all of  that could be a camera work with that  barge people think you'd go Mike just oh  alright three five suits we may append  we may like to play this if this goes  multi waving will it doesn't go it's  kind of hardware doesn't really warrant  playing in a heads-up hush whereas multi  way you've stopped more likely to get  paid when you do fruit 8 6 suited we  will be bring this in for an open if the  court opens I'm happy to call take a  flop in position  don't want to see you squeeze we don't  really like okay leaf up a pair of six  in the window always nice to see or  certainly not folding I raisin will be  somewhat suicidal here though how many  checks still say I'm gonna better that  said I round a little bit just for  protection there are quite a number of  bad turned cards for us and that's not I  mean it's not the best obviously was  certainly not the worst and I'd imagine  he bets swooshed Rose here if he flops  it so you could just bet three streets  here I mean I'm not really afraid of  many 9x here so I'm gonna bet here in  look to get called by King can't really  go that large given what this fortress  straight on the board just hope it does  not King nine but even if you ask a  night I don't imagine he raises here  with the flush on board so we value on  ourselves a little bit versus that exact  time but he had like king queen king  Jack anything like that then I would  imagine we see a call here pretty  frequently  get the full through so he certainly  isn't folding a better hat about to  Paradise we did of the best hunt almost  certainly so we were correct in going  good buddy thank my overall thought  process is finding the way it's as I  said it's very difficult for him to have  a mind and ace and an ace let's see if  we can get some actually only we just  take down the blinds definitely not what  we wanted to take it for our suit looks  we're gonna be able to do here and the  King Trey blind versus blind we will go  for the steal hopefully he just Falls if  he calls I mean it's not a disaster we  don't get through that though we do not  call or for bet King tree off suit we've  been getting fairly abused with three  bets this session so far we've been  getting badly abused actually possibly  should have sprinkled in some more in  liked for bets but we haven't really had  many good hands to do with I've got a  fairly well-defined for betting  arrangement just happened to happen  haven't happened to have any of them in  the situations where we've gotten three  bed queen Jack student we will like to  bring this in for three bets if it was  if there was any open before us but  there wasn't so we just open it  ourselves  obviously we will call we're not folding  this to a three bet depending on the  size in here where I'd like you to see a  turn if you get was like really baked  we'll just let it go but if he goes a  kind of half polish yeah we're gonna  coat we pick up a good shush it's not a  fantastically good card for solar and  though if he does fired again here I  guess we're just gonna let this one go  and not the flop we want to do with Jack  and the jack up in the top  left table so buddy checks here twice I  do magic we have the best time pretty  frequently but it's just good like  getting paid but like sevens eights  nines stuff like that just seems like  it's not gonna happen all that often so  we're just gonna check if he bets we  have a really annoying decision so we  did with the best hand I would assume  he's gonna have a pocket pair there very  often but not we just Chuck and the  Queen pretty loose call and kind of  surprised when people check back there I  expect him to have shown in value kind  of surprised he's got like just no  showing a lot so ever I think usually  people are kind of confident enough that  they realize they need to take a stab  oh well hey that's been me guys I hope  you have enjoyed the session obviously  not a fantastic result for us but  overall I'm happy with how it played  through we don't the only reason we lost  was because of any single hand  essentially towards the end the session  maybe we played a little bit possibly at  certain spots but overall I'm happy I  feel that we played it pretty well and  overall you know it is what it is if you  have any questions comments queries  about any of the hands that we've played  for you're free to fire them at me I do  is monitor the social media like YouTube  or VIP forums etc so if you've any  questions queries about any of the hands  feel free to let me know I don't do my  best to get back to you I hope you have  enjoyed what you've seen I will chat you  all soon guys that take care and have a  good day\n\n00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.730 align:start position:0%\nhey guys this is fertile poker VIP  welcome to part 2 of our cash game  series over uncle's poker fight a mix of  2250 and hell I just this is a direct  continuation from part one if anyone  hasn't seen that feel free to do so you  can see how we have the playing so far  and anywhere any kind of specific Reed's  that you have any of the players here  will of all been garnered in part one so  if you want to check that out feel free  to do so but they will of course be  standalone episodes so there's no  obligation to do that at a station  offsuit on the top right table we're  happy to bring this in for an open we  got three about unfortunately we're  gonna have to let this go  it sucks here cuz this guy he's a half  stocker and he's just kind of calling  and then calling again he's almost  certainly gonna be one of the weaker  players so we definitely want to get  involved with pots against him we have a  queen out of the small blind we're gonna  be three betting Don Lemon he's been one  of the more aggressive players so far  this session so we have potentially  gonna be going to war if we three bet  any for bets it's not really an that I'm  planning on folding kbits we don't  really have any read up we have the no  pair we're gonna start this off with a  check out of check Cole pretty difficult  board until connected that's strongly  with a turn we take the need against his  9x we're afraid of king X obviously and  now we are afraid of 10x  don't envision waves folding here will  see his son will see a sizing if he  doesn't like to bash I don't think we're  applying unfolding I mean I think I was  particularly enormous wheedle considers  but I mean if it does go enormous it  just curve looks as somewhat bloody so I  think we were we're planning on calling  down there versus most size and he did  in fact half the night so we got a  little look six Jack offsuit people let  go and okay suited on the button it's  reasonably playable this guy he's got  some chips he might feel a little bit  more frivolous than you might normally  would so we're happy to see pots in  position against him see if we can make  a strong hand and look to play a big  part definite borderline call sucks that  we got to squeeze behind we're not  getting the worst of prices whoops I  said I called the call of a single raise  is my limit here at the king in suit it  was margin the best year for facing the  three bet I think we're just gonna let  it go  I wanna get four bet it's obviously very  even more trivial will open the pocket  threes though on the top right table we  take down the blinds a seven no good  nine straight off of it  potential pop ruin here in the a  sideboard when it goes three way and you  see bets no just bet fold fold no action  five Jack in the big blind of soup not  much we're gonna be able to do here  forget a walk that would be fantastic  hey six suited we will bring this in for  an open definitely don't mind us take  another blinds here we see a flop  well fired a single at least one bet  here in this flop with the potential to  fire on multiple violence we do not have  to that Queen would have been a card I'd  be bargaining for sure and King trial  suits we will fill ace deuce is gonna be  good enough to open for the cutoff uh  ten three on the bottom right table we  will just be letting this one go even  face the minute open like obvious we're  getting a very good price so it's  obviously you're completely trashy and  ace queen of the small almost certainly  gonna be playing this one  okay tapas this guy just let calls which  is the sign indicative of a weaker  player it's pretty unlikely he is one of  the better players for sure when he's  just name calling there because he was  just like you I'm calling on the button  as well which is just something you  should just you should never do it's I  mean if you've got a hand that's good  enough to play just bring it in for a  race there's so much inherent value in  just taking down the blinds even if you  even if you have like even if you're  trapping with allegations or something  like that there's just so much inherent  value not allowing your opponent to see  your free flop and you just just a good  standard obviously never never open them  not alone with this ten at all this  sizing is kind of tilting  all right Bufo old youth old oops too  many by rivers for us if we do billions  like it obviously we don't look the best  time there very often anyway there's  just not that many good cards first on  the river take Queen we will let go also  we well the seven six potential action  border but the top left table obviously  a lot of potential to strong hands  possible there but no no significant  action going it 7:6 offsuit open the top  left table not read much we're going to  be able to do here if this goes multi  way we will consider seeing a flop it's  still gonna be close this guy calls me  definitely called I guess so I guess  we're calling either way bush life here  being at a position just looks hard and  this fact three bets that makes it much  easier decision for us and the six seven  over here when it's not a multi-way posh  we just let it go  obviously it's a button open so it's a  bit of a weak arrange all range but it's  still gonna be very very tricky to turn  a profit there okay pocket fives easy  open blind versus blind take down the  blinds no harm no fell okay we're gonna  call and take flop here although  squeezing is actually quite attractive  let's go for the squeeze instead  so not shocked this guy calls but this  is the guy I mean this has happened at  once already where he's just gonna call  and just give it up easily on the flop  so let's hope he does it again we're  gonna see we're gonna fire one and done  here and a lot of words and obviously we  can potentially just hit a sneaky-ass  strong hand as well not in love with  life that this guy is stuck arranged  we are gonna bet this board though I had  no reason to go particularly larger I  think this will get the job done for the  most parts and we have a sneaky very  strong I'm gonna the top right table I  was gonna go all-in and hope he has the  tent never take down the bottom right  table which we love actually checking  here might have been better cuz he  always bets it ends right and he might  blow yeah check checking that was those  a mistake checking would be better there  cuz he never checks back to straight and  if we do check and he has like for  example with diamonds is it's entirely  possible that he that he elects for a  bluff so we want to give him that  opportunity so that that all-in was bad  actually that was that I didn't I didn't  think through my options there it's  amazing like hey I mean like a you know  take millions of hands of Poker but  still like just just little small  setback just take an extra like three or  four seconds of things for your options  it can make a huge difference to your  winners like obviously those kind of  situations they don't come up all that  often but if you play them just a little  bit better every single time it does  make it it adds up but it makes a pretty  big difference so I'm annoyed at myself  that hey these things happened we're not  gonna it's not gonna be the first  mistake I'll make it's not gonna be the  last sorry it's not the first mistake  should I say I certainly won't be the  last  that's nice 7 suited one got rid the  coat off we're happy to bring in for an  open  we take it down I King Jack will be  going for the open again I rested under  the golden arches like this we'll go  yeah we can't consider three betting  here but folding versus month ago to  open seems reasonably prudent as well 10  Jack suited in the bottom-left table we  shall bring it in and we got three bets  here we will see the flop here he's made  quite small I'm getting over 2 2 1 our  money and we have a hand that has the  potential to flop quite well and we get  to go multi-way so that's added gravy  okay we would like if there's at least  one Spade here but we have the open  ender so that's pretty good we're  getting an exceptionally good price here  so we will certainly be seeing a turn  so our options here now are to go for  the check or we can also lead we are  going to go for the check  I'm gonna go for the big over right here  and expected to fold a nice pretty often  we just wrap a flow here so hard  Oh whoops heinous the top to burrow but  honestly I would have expect he seems  like a more of a rakish player so I  wouldn't expect him to throw those types  of hands books cuz it's kinda it's just  how it's hard for us to have that many  gloves there so when the over back we  just incredibly noted but obviously he  has the Queen blocker which is quite  good for him like he blocks our full  heads and stuff like that as well but we  can definitely be playing we can  definitely have solutions that take that  line so I think if he I was like hey  Stan he's jack stuff like that he almost  certainly folds the ace queen is  probably just a little bit too strong  but hey no harm no foul who loses think  that was a 30 euro bash plus whatever so  we use like 35 40 you're almost to buy  in but not the end of the world  that's probably put us down for this  session  yeah we're certainly down a little bit  for the session I was hopefully maybe  had to get it back before we kick back  off the King 10 we will be going for the  open up on the top right tail we're  gonna call with the fives after we take  it down to content will be open to a 7 I  bet the board for pocket fives or some  enough fold into a single that we pick  up and open under to go along with our  pair sure bad about you will call it  again thanks pretty good it should  really shut him down I feel like if he  does I had like tens Jack's queens  anything like that it should really  showed him down here so if we triple  borrows I will be suspicious I'll be  suspicious to say the least  he does slow down which is I mean if he  if he'd bet big there I don't know we  would have been a tricky spot I don't  think we were planning on folding I had  we decided to peel one off here with no  hair and the good shot to the notice  when we even the kindest it seems kind  of reductive for me do flush we hit our  ace with that what he just bets  absolutely massive there on the diamond  it's just it's just a spot where it's  really hard for us to be ahead it's kind  of hard for him to have that many gloves  against the designed here like he bet  this flop and then he just bonds  eternity bombs it absolutely enormous as  well so he's just he's just committed  himself and I just don't envision him  doing that with like you know if he is a  king queen or something like that maybe  first king queen isn't the queen of  diamond that the king of king or queen  of diamonds or something to that effect  it's possible but overall they expect us  to be in trouble there quite frequently  and it's really hard from the out like a  stone cold Bluff there so just letting  her hand go seems more prudent to Levin  and not okay we peels this turn every  second people a flop brother I'm just  gonna bet quite small here just we're  just gonna protect around a little bit  because look that value for my case X  that I picked up a good show zone it was  like a nice tanner something like that  there's a pretty decent shot see calls  with overs and a good shush  and qui 10 we just let this little girl  nine five on the button not much you're  going to be able to do nine six suited  in the big blind over the top left table  as definitely some potential will defend  here ideally we'd like to see this go  multi way if it doesn't we'll just let  it go  they don't fall suited cards is that  often versus number two gone open though  who's got that little bit of a stronger  range it's fine as I said if that goes  multi way we're definitely we're  definitely peeling and taking a flop in  a position or no King seminar super yet  tonight go at deuce three we're not  gonna be doing anything here other than  folding pocket kings let's see if we can  get a little pot Brown here I can clean  up in the top left table definitely  wouldn't mind a little bit of action  here either I'll go for the three but  here in the bottom obviously we want to  see player four bring in a large squeeze  which doesn't do K board obviously sets  our concern and you know has like eight  nine but overall not the worst of words  but any stretch the imagination  not a boy word forever gonna be all that  comfortable like we get if we bet you  get raised here we're kind of sad but  there are a decent number of hands that  kind of definitely just call which is  what we want don't mind seeing this at  all  we've got a full house down in the  bottom right table obviously one of the  weaker phil has is a weaker possible to  flop we're pretty much just some jet  come out here for the most part I had  the five we like a lot there's one  written to e3 potentially take this down  and fold them off at shop with like a  really large over it  this guy bets quite large which is  annoying as hell I'm not a fan I've just  called him for jumps no I had this jack  I mean it's good and bad so you can have  ten Jack which is good he could have  like a nine Jack as well which is bad  oh no inquiry we're just gonna we're  just gonna ship it in if he has a hand  looking call he's gonna call most  sizings we're not playing I've told him  if he bets himself so might as well look  to punish him as much as possible the  only thing going for smaller size in  there would be if he has I'm the case in  nine maybe he calls a smaller size but  overall I'm I prefer just going from  it's fine election weekend weekend  occasionally I hear up there my second  parents don't like that anyway so we're  not automatically giving up the pot if  he just says like ace nine and stuff  like that and as I said ten Jack will  make up a reasonable part of his range  there when he calls to streets having  the open ended with overs so we want to  make sure we punish him when he has  River duck top parrot I panic  obviously sucks if he has a hand like to  pair like nine Jack or something like  that that gets there in the river but as  I said if if he has that we're gonna be  using a large bet anyway if we check or  if we bet small and he jams like we're  never folding anyway and I presume any  jams all those two pairs pluses if we do  bet smaller so it doesn't really change  too much the ACE for we like to go on  the bottom due to the air in a position  open by eight  a queen under the gun obviously no good  neither is the deuce 4 4 7 8 Oh suit in  the cutoff we're not planning on  bringing that in a full suit we  obviously open - Brooks offsuit variety  we're happy just to let it go  a stray in the big blind we shall see  how the action develops there are some  scenarios where we like to play this  might use it was a three that Bluff here  if the blunt goes for the open which he  does your 5 has already gone for the 3  met those so I guess we let these guys  battle it out  looks like we're about to see a flop  here at the for 5o suit oh that would  have been a pretty decent flop for us I  was sneaky without a man it would have  been extremely undisguised  okay ace Jack pretty strong attention to  play and let's see take a flop here at  the 45 a flat bottom pair with depending  on the sizing we make sure : Street  that's a really bad turn for a really  bad turn not a huge fan of cold calling  three bets here but given this guy is  propensity to call and see well to it  like see see flops like that I expect us  cultivate really frequently and I'm okay  I mean it's it's not like an amazing  scenario but taking a check is fine  where this guy seems to be on the  slightly more aggressive side you've  seen him three about a few hands now and  so it's like it's not like he's just  kind of limited to not at hands it's  just a case now or they want to make a  play at this board I think I do so let's  make it four ready to go this is very  much just a one and done bet unless we  manage to beat that ace that you don't  okay but on my table we have picked up  top two pair there is a potential flush  neither we just fell liked our opponent  obviously what's referred to get more  action there it's not the word where I'm  ever gonna be still playing really  though I'm happy just to go ahead and  bet okay nine ten suited we are going to  flat Co this is the same flare that we  run our large bluff on earlier on so  there are some scenarios where we can  over bet quite liberty for value and  expect to get called a bit lighter  unfortunately but work does not allow us  to see the flop so we aren't going to  have two folds face jutsu is an art size  although we are a reason big deep  wouldn't have been obscene to cold take  a block there but I'd be pretty  surprised if returning a profit by doing  so and one of the worst flops imaginable  for the pocket raise we just let this  will go there are some boards where we  will continue without hitting our set  but the basic aim for ain't one of them  okay coming ten sue down the bottom left  table let's see if we can see a  multi-way flop which you can flap top  pair okay kicker far from a disaster  please spots the where our kicker isn't  reading all that red ons because it's  pretty unlikely they've got like that  many Queen I or Queen eight or worse  okay I'm just gonna wait you're here now  and probably bet most rivers to gonna  get value from like pocket jacks pocket  eights pocket tens but also we block it  that cut those types of hands we get one  fold dart Elaine because he checked back  this flop were not really afraid of any  I got on the vision I'm ever checking  back a better Queen and I don't really  envision him still playing sets or  anything like that that board and I'm  will tear apart either so when this  Joe's checked through I expect that the  best time there the Queen Amina  frequently and you know our hands  there's way more bad cards than good  cards for hands there's no real there's  no value really and in not betting  they're just allow two opponents of free  opportunity to catch up Bay City okay we  flop the toughest of the pair's what's  the toughest of the kicker's up on the  top right table and fortunately now  actually know obviously aboard we were  really hoping to get paid  I'm you married looking to get stocks it  or anything like it's pretty difficult  to get you know a single parent for  stocks in a single raise partly a hinge  boat we were gonna be looking for  multiple streets of body obviously okay  queen eight blind versus blind when we  do not fold we flop a second pair live  up to bear obviously the two pair isn't  all that great and we improved to better  two-parent we have three paradigm wears  been a cold in here he has the a side of  the king nice hand sir nice hand I don't  think we can really do too much  different there we're getting two to one  with the Queen eight blind versus blind  versus a very wide range so Queen H is  going to be doing well enough to hold  getting such a good price when we've got  the pair they're on the ACA sex George  we you know we can't fall to a single  bet for sure  turn betting turn would have been a  mistake and then river I mean I don't  think we can ever fill my reader so  happy with how it played it all right  and at least nine we opened up in the  top right to Queen four in the bottom  left we let go Don Lemon has been  getting at the better it was so far this  session all of Oliver we were doing  quite well all of our profit has been  going that way move around the big  bluefin him over at the bottom left  table earlier on where he had East the  Queen and we had the Miss straight row  and he's been definitely getting the  better of us I've never find a saying  which they may not asleep it click the  ten Jack had was you know necessarily  necessarily Bluff I always hate that  term though where there's something is  necessary and I felt to be profitable  I still do feeling to be profitable I  mean without the Queen without blocking  that those extra full houses I know how  to be surprised if he calls there were  just a lonely spot maybe it does I mean  Ice Queen isn't all that different like  the hands I'm wrapping ace Queen who's  doing a justice like if you were of them  a favor play Queens that way but  I think I think he can fold a nice there  pretty frequently so I'm okay with it  okay we're gonna go for the three but  here this guy has been reasonably active  so far so we're obviously wrapping quite  strong here with this kind of hand but  3-betting it from under the gun plus 1  we get the respect we deserve all right  we have open to the a stray we flap top  hair with the backdoor flush draw  bedding here it doesn't really  accomplish too much it loves the posh  which we're not really a fan of doing in  this with this kind of kind of type of  hand strength and purely because it's  you know if we do better if we better  and get cold we're against essentially  flush draws or battery sex primarily so  when we check more fun things could  happen we can we can induce some Bluffs  so he is like you know king queen here  something like that he might just elect  to stab and I guess we're just gonna  check hold here again betting for value  seems incredibly optimistic like I don't  imagine a pad like a so here at King  Knight get 10 9  Jack Knight anything that calls his  pocket queens because I mean maybe if  maybe that exact time calls perhaps I'm  kind of surprised you didn't three bet  that free that seems bad feel like he  should absolutely be three betting that  hand as six nine soon if this guy is  essentially been open so we're starting  off folding we're not in love with this  Queen but we don't hate it  enough that we're just going to check  fold so we are going to call and see a  river the jack we don't like either a  few bets again we let this one go  I didn't want to see a diamond that we  didn't want to see a Broadway card  pretty kits there we call that River but  I'm pretty sure he did cope quite large  but I still still think we're gonna make  that call and the jack though there's  just some extra cards although maybe  he's not really gonna be betting us  Jack's there so maybe I'm maybe only  correct in saying that but overall I  think letting letting the third pair go  they're facing a large river bed it's  going to be absolutely fine we have been  spewing a little bit of chips here on  this table you might need to tighten up  a little bit  we've only got like four or five more  minutes left to go so let's see if we  can think ourselves at decent pot and  again ourselves a day say where we're  down somewhere in the ballpark of 20  euro ish since we started this so all of  that could be a camera work with that  barge people think you'd go Mike just oh  alright three five suits we may append  we may like to play this if this goes  multi waving will it doesn't go it's  kind of hardware doesn't really warrant  playing in a heads-up hush whereas multi  way you've stopped more likely to get  paid when you do fruit 8 6 suited we  will be bring this in for an open if the  court opens I'm happy to call take a  flop in position  don't want to see you squeeze we don't  really like okay leaf up a pair of six  in the window always nice to see or  certainly not folding I raisin will be  somewhat suicidal here though how many  checks still say I'm gonna better that  said I round a little bit just for  protection there are quite a number of  bad turned cards for us and that's not I  mean it's not the best obviously was  certainly not the worst and I'd imagine  he bets swooshed Rose here if he flops  it so you could just bet three streets  here I mean I'm not really afraid of  many 9x here so I'm gonna bet here in  look to get called by King can't really  go that large given what this fortress  straight on the board just hope it does  not King nine but even if you ask a  night I don't imagine he raises here  with the flush on board so we value on  ourselves a little bit versus that exact  time but he had like king queen king  Jack anything like that then I would  imagine we see a call here pretty  frequently  get the full through so he certainly  isn't folding a better hat about to  Paradise we did of the best hunt almost  certainly so we were correct in going  good buddy thank my overall thought  process is finding the way it's as I  said it's very difficult for him to have  a mind and ace and an ace let's see if  we can get some actually only we just  take down the blinds definitely not what  we wanted to take it for our suit looks  we're gonna be able to do here and the  King Trey blind versus blind we will go  for the steal hopefully he just Falls if  he calls I mean it's not a disaster we  don't get through that though we do not  call or for bet King tree off suit we've  been getting fairly abused with three  bets this session so far we've been  getting badly abused actually possibly  should have sprinkled in some more in  liked for bets but we haven't really had  many good hands to do with I've got a  fairly well-defined for betting  arrangement just happened to happen  haven't happened to have any of them in  the situations where we've gotten three  bed queen Jack student we will like to  bring this in for three bets if it was  if there was any open before us but  there wasn't so we just open it  ourselves  obviously we will call we're not folding  this to a three bet depending on the  size in here where I'd like you to see a  turn if you get was like really baked  we'll just let it go but if he goes a  kind of half polish yeah we're gonna  coat we pick up a good shush it's not a  fantastically good card for solar and  though if he does fired again here I  guess we're just gonna let this one go  and not the flop we want to do with Jack  and the jack up in the top  left table so buddy checks here twice I  do magic we have the best time pretty  frequently but it's just good like  getting paid but like sevens eights  nines stuff like that just seems like  it's not gonna happen all that often so  we're just gonna check if he bets we  have a really annoying decision so we  did with the best hand I would assume  he's gonna have a pocket pair there very  often but not we just Chuck and the  Queen pretty loose call and kind of  surprised when people check back there I  expect him to have shown in value kind  of surprised he's got like just no  showing a lot so ever I think usually  people are kind of confident enough that  they realize they need to take a stab  oh well hey that's been me guys I hope  you have enjoyed the session obviously  not a fantastic result for us but  overall I'm happy with how it played  through we don't the only reason we lost  was because of any single hand  essentially towards the end the session  maybe we played a little bit possibly at  certain spots but overall I'm happy I  feel that we played it pretty well and  overall you know it is what it is if you  have any questions comments queries  about any of the hands that we've played  for you're free to fire them at me I do  is monitor the social media like YouTube  or VIP forums etc so if you've any  questions queries about any of the hands  feel free to let me know I don't do my  best to get back to you I hope you have  enjoyed what you've seen I will chat you  all soon guys that take care and have a  good day\n \n\n00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.570 align:start position:0%\n \n \n\n00:00:07.570 -->

</c><00:00:01.948><c>the </c><00:00:01.949><c>next </c><00:00:01.950><c>video </c><00:00:01.951><c>bye</c>\n\n00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.230 align:start position:0%\nhey guys so i'm here today to film  another getting ready video i got a lot  of positive feedback from  my um  last getting ready video and i was like  you know i'll do it again because  there's so much positive feedback thank  you guys so much for um all the nice  things you said too by the way  um  so i was figuring i have to film today  so i might as well do another getting  ready video and this time i'm using more  high-end products i'm gonna go ahead and  get started  and clip my hair back  i did curl my hair with my nume one inch  clipless curling wand okay so today i'm  actually going to be finishing up the  same well this is the makeup forever  um matt valet plus  and i have this big light in front of me  so i'm like blinded but um this is in  number 40  and i just want to use this up because i  have just like a little bit left i don't  know if you can see because that light  but um  i have a little bit left so i'm gonna  take this sigma f88 brush i love this  brush for foundation it's one of my  favorites  and i'm just going to  put this  all over my face  i think this is the foundation i'm gonna  get the full size of because i think  it's gonna be great  for winter  so  this might be the one i get we'll have  to see i just love  like i said in one of my other videos  you can just totally tell the difference  between  high-end foundations and drugstore  foundations like when they're on your  skin it's just it's insane  how different  they are and if i sound a little  different or if i cough a lot or  something i am getting kind of sick i  like rarely get sick but  ever since i started dating  colton  um every time he gets sick he like  passes it on to me so now i'm going to  take this dermablend concealer this is  insable you've seen this so many times  in my videos because i use it literally  all the time  apply a little bit of this on my cheeks  just a tiny bit  cover up any extra redness peeking  through  using that same brush  just going to put that  on my cheeks and blend it out  i just love this foundation it looks so  nice you guys if you haven't tried the  makeup forever matte velvet plush you  should because it's really nice  i like a little toothpaste on it lip  lips sorry  and in the camera it looks or in the  viewfinder doesn't look like my neck  matches my face but i think it's just  the lighting because  it does match but bronzer will help that  um going to do my under eye concealer i  use this all the time the rimmel match  perfection concealer and light i'm gonna  use this today  and i love this stuff i love it so good  so placing that  underneath my eyes a little bit of a  triangle  you can blend that my fingers  under eye concealer is on just going to  blend a little bit like with the tip of  this brush  and then i'm going to take of course the  makeup forever hd powder love this stuff  a lot of you are telling me  maybe i won't be using that because i  really don't feel like getting up the  lush emotional brilliance powder i  haven't used this in forever  so that's what it looks like showed in a  haul or i didn't show it in a haul  because i didn't get it in my bag but  i'm gonna be using this  to set  my under eye concealer and also just go  ahead and set my face stuff so  um  take it  and  pat away oh crap i just like  poured a buttload that's the only thing  i hate this does not have a sifter at  all so  it's one of those things that just  pisses you off when you try to work with  it maybe that's why i haven't used it so  long peg powder brush and i'm just going  to  put this all over this is a great matte  powder if it had a sifter it'd be  perfect  and  if you have the makeup forever powder  does anyone else think it smells weird i  think it smells kind of weird  that might be  the only one but  it smells weird  okay i'm going to take my chanel soleil  10-day chanel bronzer this is what it  looks like  and there's the back in case you're  wondering about names and stuff  this is what it looks like it's like a  cream bronzer but if you have oily skin  i've said this before don't be scared of  it because it's not going to like be  super creamy  but this sort of goes on and it sort of  dries to a powder it doesn't look like a  cream at all it's very natural very very  pretty um for this bronzer i'm using  this  crown brush contour brush or contour  blush whatever i'm gonna use it for  bronzer um a little bit of this stuff  does go a long way so every time i swirl  my brush and the product i will tap off  excess and then i'll just start applying  it where i would usually like apply like  a contour why is my ear so red you guys  see that um but i'll apply this where i  usually apply my contour so  right here  and i'll just drag it up the side of my  face and go to the top of my forehead  and it's just a really nice natural  bronzer like i'm obsessed with it can  you tell the difference  i love it so again  tap off excess and just  kind of contour with it  okay  now i'm just going to  kind of buff out that contour  just so it doesn't look too harsh with  this crown brush brush i don't know what  it's called  um doesn't have a name on it but that's  what it looks like it's like a big brush  for brush you can use any sort of big  dense brush and it'll work fine  so  there we go  that's better right yep  okay and i'm gonna go ahead and do blush  and for today's blush i'm gonna be using  the nars dan mori palette this is sin  it's one of my favorite colors from nars  i'm obsessed with it so this is the  color i'll be using  and i'm just going to apply that  on my cheeks  this is one of the colors that i would  go out by the full size of because i  love it so much especially for fall and  winter  it's really pretty  okay now for eyes i'm gonna zoom you  guys in okay so i'm going to take  soft ochre from mac  i'm going to prime my eyes  and i have four mac shades that i'm  going to be using today i'll go ahead  and show you them  um  we have  omega  saddle which i used to talk about all  the time  got espresso  and antique which is a really pretty  color especially for fall so  those are the kind of colors i'll be  using today and the first one i'm going  to take is  saddle from mac and i'm going to take a  blending brush  i'm just going to put this in my crease  like a transition color  i hope you guys can see this  okay and then we're going to take um  antiqued  so we're just going to take a flat  shader brush that kind of looks like  that  this is the sigma e55 and we're going to  take antiqued  which is this color and i'm going to  apply this sort of from the middle of my  eye to the outer  part to the outer v so  just pour it in the middle and i'll  apply it all over that's what we'll do  so apply this color  kind of lightly  all over the lid  i always end up changing my mind like  right when i'm doing something then i'm  going to take an angle brush  like  this  nice angle brush taking  from mac  and take that angle brush  and just deepen out the outer v  then we're going to  blend blem blend i know i keep looking  the viewfinder but i'm trying to try to  see if i'm in here and if i'm if you  guys can see what i'm doing because last  time you guys really wanted me to  zoom in more i'm not going to zoom in  really closely on like when i do face  products because i kind of feel like  that's pointless but  everything else like eyes and stuff i'll  zoom in on  so that's what it looks like i'm going  to take just a little bit of omega  so just a little bit of omega i'm just  going to kind of take this right above  where saddle ends  i'm really quickly going to take  brulee from wet and wild see this is  like  one of those videos that you just do it  as you go but i like those kinds of  videos right  so this is brulee it's a nice matte  cream color from wet n wild i'm gonna  put this right underneath my brow  this is a gorgeous highlight  great for drugstore wet n wild is so  pigmented  and it's definitely worth trying out if  you've never tried them before putting  this in my inner corner  it's really like the inner part of the  lid too just to brighten it up some  all right and now we're going to take  the l'oreal hip liner talk about this a  lot  so it looks like going to line  my  waterline  now taking my favorite liquid liner this  is the rimmel exaggerate liner  that's what it looks like i've been  completely obsessed with it and of  course what am i gonna do i'm gonna do a  winged liner  so  really quickly going to take this pencil  brush  taking um expresso from mac i'm going to  smudge this underneath my bottom lash  line then we're going to curl our lashes  and apply some mascara i'll have a  mascara routine video up  soon if i don't have it up now if i have  it up now i'll link it in this video  because there's no point you see me do  my mascara if i've already done a video  on it so  oh okay so  these are the finished eyes they're nice  simple  kind of smoky but  that's what i like  for lip gloss i'm just gonna use nyx  sugar pie it's just a nice nude color  and that is it  so i hope you guys enjoyed this little  getting ready video there is the  finished face i hope you guys  enjoyed this video i know i probably  didn't talk as much because i was like  concentrating on stuff i needed i was  wanting to do for makeup but i hope you  guys enjoy this and i will see you all  in the next video bye\n \n\n00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.230 align:start position:0%\n \n \n\n00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.909 align:start position:0%\n \n \n\n00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.990 align:start

decorate my notebook they buy sped stay  with me and subscribe to my channel I  have this white pages book that has a  black spin that I love and I'm going to  use it the first thing to do is to  measure the cover size then cut a nice  paper 1 centimeter bigger than the  covers when you have it done place on  the covers then use some silicone and  glue the front and back cover  use a cutter to remove the leftover  look into your paper cards some streets  about two and a half centimeters wide  and cut the ends to make the banners  put the banners on the cover  intercalating colors then cut them in  the sizes you  as soon as you have all the banners  ready shadow the borders using some  vintage shuttle  now make the same shadows on the covers  you  now decide the place of each banner then  glue them with silicon  to make the books label cut with friend  leads a big label and a small one in  white paper  shado their borders and do them  put a little butterfly as decoration so  punch it shadow its borders and glue it  to make it more vintage  shadows the shades borders  you  as you can see the book is almost ready  so we'll put something else  these butterflies that will help me to  mark pages and decorate a little bit  more before clicking right now on the  screen you watch how did I make them I  hope you liked this project mark as  favorite and post a like subscribe
