<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.59" dur="5.549">is Jody with welding tips and tricks&amp;#39;  calm we&amp;#39;re going old-school TIG today  I&amp;#39;ve got an old Lincoln tombstone AC  buzz box and I&amp;#39;ve got two old do  yourself rectifier that I hooked up to  it  and we&amp;#39;re going to do scratch start TIG  that&amp;#39;s the old rectifier I traded for  that years ago and it works it&amp;#39;s really  heavy-duty and stick around at the end  of the video and we&amp;#39;re going to run some  really noisy beads on a block of Steel  with this thing stick around a little  bit later in the video I&amp;#39;ll run several  beads and we&amp;#39;ll kind of check out and  see what this little buzz box dry rig  scratch start thing can do well that&amp;#39;s  the set up rectifier is set on top of an  AC Lincoln tune stone welder got the  stinger basically hooked into one cable  that was already attached probably not  the best way to have it all hooked up  but just for the purposes of a quick  demo on this machine I just clamped the  things to the cables that were already  attached and you can see right there  some really heavy cables and diodes and  whatnot attached to the big aluminum  channel buses to kind of separate  everything it&amp;#39;s a heavy-duty unit at  least 35 years old I traded for it over  20 years ago and I know there&amp;#39;s a little  bit of the story behind it so it&amp;#39;s an  old homemade rectifier but you gotta lay  electrode negative coming out right here  and that&amp;#39;s the one that goes to the TIG  torch speaking of the TIG torch I&amp;#39;ve got  an old old TIG torch that I traded for  over 30 years ago it&amp;#39;s a CK and look at  the name on that it&amp;#39;s calmly and klepon  I didn&amp;#39;t even know that&amp;#39;s what CK&amp;#39;s  stood for until I got this old torch out  but that&amp;#39;s an old heavy-duty air-cooled  TIG torch from CK been around a while  see the valve on there is to turn the  gas off when you&amp;#39;re done you need that  if you&amp;#39;re using a dry rig you can you  can well without it but you&amp;#39;ll waste a  lot of gas cuz you&amp;#39;ll forget to walk  over to the flow meter and turn it off  when you&amp;#39;re done run a bead and speaking  of the flow meter again I trade it for  this thing over 30 years ago it&amp;#39;s a  heavy duty air co flow meter thing  weighs about 10 pounds it&amp;#39;s old its  heavy-duty its rugged it&amp;#39;ll probably be  around a long time I&amp;#39;ve had it well over  30 years and I think it was pretty old  when I traded for it so it&amp;#39;s rugged but  the argon hose from the TIG torch though  to the flowmeter the cable goes to the  welding machine and that&amp;#39;s about it use  a little different wrinkle in this  because I&amp;#39;ve always found that scratch  start TIG wasn&amp;#39;t that big a deal to get  started that wasn&amp;#39;t the deal that was  stopping you know when you got a whip  out snap out that&amp;#39;s when you that&amp;#39;s when  that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s hard to be delicate  like I say lighting up is no problem but  when you Traill out you got to speed up  and then whip out and of course you lose  argon shielding and you can have some  little minimal defect that on pipe is  very easy to file and brush but on  stainless steel sheet food service  equipment or something like that be very  difficult to clean that up so being able  to stop and maintaining shielding is a  real big deal for a lot of things back  in the day when I was doing a lot of  pipe weld and I would have my fitter  just hold the hold of stinger to the tab  in his hands and when I get finished and  get ready to whip out I just say okay  and he pulled it apart and and I&amp;#39;d stop  the weld and the benefit of that is I  maintain gas shielding and wouldn&amp;#39;t have  to do all that filing and brushing so  it&amp;#39;s not good for everything is you  still have to kind of trail out on a  route pass to keep from leaving a crater  fisheye whatever but it does have a lot  of value like you could do a lot of  stainless steel foodservice type stuffs  sheet metal with a scratch start TIG and  if you&amp;#39;re able to stop and maintain  shielding it makes a huge difference so  I put together a little foot pedal it&amp;#39;s  just a switch it&amp;#39;s not a amperage  control it&amp;#39;s just a simple switch made  out of a knife switch like from an  automotive application and so it&amp;#39;s very  crude a couple a couple of brackets here  knife switch it&amp;#39;s like a main shutoff  switch for a vehicle or or some tractor  or something like that so that the  five-year-old can&amp;#39;t go start it so  here&amp;#39;s what that looks like when you can  stop the weld and maintain shielding  make difference  one of these poles here will be just  were they coming out of the welding  machine now this video is not about  building a DC rectifier so just forget  about that imagine this was just the  negative output on any DC stick welder a  Miller Thunderbolt or Lincoln DC welder  any DC stick welder you the negative  side for TIG welding steel would go to  the tick torch in this case I&amp;#39;ve got it  attached to one of the poles on the foot  pedal and the other the other one is is  going to the TIG torch which again is an  old old CKD TIG torch and the other line  is the argon line that runs into TIG  torch just hooked up to the flow meter  simple set up but still being used all  over the place on construction sites and  then the stinger will hook to the other  one or I can hook directly to the will  take torch to the to the other one so  basically when I&amp;#39;m welding along here  I&amp;#39;ve got the circuit is a running  current through there and then when I  want to stop I just banged my foot on  the pedal knife switch opens and it  stops the stops the weld maybe  twenty-five bucks worth of stuff ordered  this off knife switch off Amazon you  know a little finagling a little making  brackets and putting it together with a  couple of pieces of board and it&amp;#39;s a  switch talking to a friend of mine just  just today and he was talking about when  he got out of welding school he went  into the dairy work and doing doing two  inch stainless skid 10 stainless for for  food service and you know they said  there&amp;#39;s your welding machine he said  where&amp;#39;s the foot pedal and they said  what foot pedal there&amp;#39;s no foot pedal  there&amp;#39;s your welding machine Miller  Thunderbolt hooked up to a TIG torch and  a bottle of argon Stinger hooked onto a  tab on the on the TIG torch that is very  common in construction because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s  rugged its durable and it says now it  relies on the welders skill to  compensate for foot pedal amperage  control all that stuff but it is people  who are doing people are diamond in  Wells out there every day using a simple  setup like that it&amp;#39;s not the best setup  it&amp;#39;s just rugged also when you got it  like this now your TIG torch laying  around is not hot so that&amp;#39;s kind of a  good thing if you sit on it  right so anyway hold on I&amp;#39;m getting a  call  hey baby doll how you doing hey can I  get you back air gasps guys call me  helium shortage you&amp;#39;re right that is  total BS I&amp;#39;m coming down there what up  grandma okay back to reality here one of  the things I&amp;#39;m going to do for I get  started here is I&amp;#39;m going to swap out  this big collet body cup what not it&amp;#39;s a  number eight cup it&amp;#39;s kind of got crud  on the inside of it this thing&amp;#39;s been  sitting in a gang box for years but I&amp;#39;m  going to put on what&amp;#39;s called a stubby  gas lens also from CK so the first thing  I&amp;#39;ve got to swap out the little Teflon  insulator to one that allows the cup to  seat on it I&amp;#39;ll screw in the stubby gas  lens and bang now all of a sudden I just  shortened that whole TIG torch by a lot  and it also is going to get a lot better  gas coverage I&amp;#39;ll put in the old 2%  lanthanide electrode here&amp;#39;s another tip  for you on a scratch start rig like this  you can actually start the arc by  flicking the wire like that against the  tip boom  some guys actually actually flick it  with one end and then flip it in their  hand like a you know like the drummer  from Def Leppard or something clips the  drumstick around and then feed the other  end so any contaminants are on the end  that&amp;#39;s not used there you go  there&amp;#39;s the first bead notice how noisy  that was that is a noisy noisy arc on  this thing that was one thing jumped out  at me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a fairly decent arc it&amp;#39;s  capable of doing some stuff but man so  much more noisy than I&amp;#39;m used to with  all the inverters that I&amp;#39;ve been doing  for for a long time now I&amp;#39;ll show you  all compare it here in just a second  when I get finished with this arc I left  the noise kind of up so you can&amp;#39;t tell  the difference boom now here&amp;#39;s an  inverter this is at HTTP 221 unit the  argon flow is actually louder than the  arc not saying that&amp;#39;s good or bad just  is what it is come back here with a  second bead stacking it you can notice I  noticed a little bit of difference on  this arc it seems to have quite a bit of  force to it like almost it looks almost  like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve got a small cup with a lot  of argon flow and it&amp;#39;s pushing down in  the puddle but that&amp;#39;s not what it is  I&amp;#39;ve got a normal argon flow but you see  the depressions it&amp;#39;s kind of making and  I don&amp;#39;t know what is going on there  maybe it&amp;#39;s just the you know the the  have a waveform the the current is  rougher now it&amp;#39;s smooth as a as an  inverter but it&amp;#39;s different might  actually be better for some application  certainly you&amp;#39;re showing here that that  set up like this is capable of making a  decent looking well or a decent quality  weld and I&amp;#39;m not doing anything to write  home about here on this block of Steel  but I&amp;#39;m just trying to you know since  that TIG torch has been in a box for 20  years I figured I might as well just run  some beads rather than try to weld  anything with it  there&amp;#39;s using the foot pedal maintaining  that shielding on the end so and as we  eat what it looks like stacking a bunch  of beads so you know some success all  right coming very soon in a video I&amp;#39;m  going to use the same setup same torch  and everything and a TIG finger to do a  6g sanitary tubing 2 inch weld test why  6g because if we lay it on the table and  roll it we don&amp;#39;t learn nothing besides  someone out there might be about to take  a test like this to get a job it might  mean a difference between a paycheck and  not so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing either  next or sometime very soon anyway may  not be the next video but will be very  soon and also work it&amp;#39;s still working on  this boom arm to hang that wire feeder  off of for the MIG welder I&amp;#39;m still  waiting on a part to come in and we will  get it done but it it&amp;#39;s coming shortly  well thanks for watching and visit  welding tips and tricks calm and  remember I&amp;#39;ve got another site welding -  tv.com where we use a different video  service instead of YouTube because some  schools are blocking YouTube now and the  welding - tv.com site is also where you  can purchase take fingers and DVDs and  incidentally the 2012 youtube  compilation package will be up there on  welding - TV very soon</text><text start="6.29" dur="5.3"></text><text start="9.139" dur="5.881"></text><text start="11.59" dur="5.8"></text><text start="15.02" dur="2.7"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.589" dur="4.96">hey guys welcome to the blooming city  today we&amp;#39;re going to make Vietnamese  shaking beef which is actually called  fall low flat and let&amp;#39;s get started  these are the ingredients that you&amp;#39;ll  need for this recipe you can find the  full list of ingredients on my website  at the blooming foodie calm first mins 3  garlic cloves so you put your book 2  tablespoons correct and that&amp;#39;s all  Easter shush ok next is the fish sauce 1  tablespoon 1 tablespoon divulge it&amp;#39;s no  matter what looking show there&amp;#39;s more  folks who do next add in 1 tablespoon of  soy sauce I like it a little spicy so I  add in 1 teaspoon of sriracha and 1  teaspoon of crushed red pepper but these  are completely optional to add a bit of  sweetness to the marinade add in 2  tablespoons of sugar to balance out the  salty and the sweet add in 1 teaspoon of  vinegar and mix well use about 1/2 1/2  pounds of your favorite cut of steak and  cube them in 1-inch pieces I like to use  ribeye  toss the cube steak into the marinade  and marinate for at least one hour  for the super simple vinaigrette you&amp;#39;ll  need 1/2 cup of vinegar with one and a  half tablespoons of sugar mixed with a  half tablespoon of salt and you just mix  that together and it&amp;#39;s really that  simple  use half of the vinaigrette to pickle  half of a red onion slice the other half  of the vinaigrette will be used to dress  the salad which I&amp;#39;ll show you a little  bit later for the salad you&amp;#39;ll just need  some mixed greens and maybe about 2  small Tomatoes after the steak is  marinated heat up a small amount of oil  in the pan or preferably a wok on high  heat  once the oil begins to smoke cook the  steak and the marinade  be sure to flip the beef or shake the  pan to brown all sides of the steak  you&amp;#39;ll know your steak is finished  cooking when the sauce begins to  caramelize  use the remainder of the vinaigrette to  dress the salad  you  serve the steak on top of the dress  salad and top the salad off with the  pickled red onions  I had some leftover vinaigrette so I  chopped off the entire dish with some  more vinaigrette but this is completely  optional finish the dish off with some  freshly ground black pepper and that&amp;#39;s  it  all right time to dig in oh my god look  at this carmelization that we got on the  meat mmm  meet Toby  hmm that&amp;#39;s good  Osgood Osgood for the full recipe please  visit my blog at the blooming foodie

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.08" dur="4.16">hey guys so i&amp;#39;m here today to film  another getting ready video i got a lot  of positive feedback from  my um  last getting ready video and i was like  you know i&amp;#39;ll do it again because  there&amp;#39;s so much positive feedback thank  you guys so much for um all the nice  things you said too by the way  um  so i was figuring i have to film today  so i might as well do another getting  ready video and this time i&amp;#39;m using more  high-end products i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and  get started  and clip my hair back  i did curl my hair with my nume one inch  clipless curling wand okay so today i&amp;#39;m  actually going to be finishing up the  same well this is the makeup forever  um matt valet plus  and i have this big light in front of me  so i&amp;#39;m like blinded but um this is in  number 40  and i just want to use this up because i  have just like a little bit left i don&amp;#39;t  know if you can see because that light  but um  i have a little bit left so i&amp;#39;m gonna  take this sigma f88 brush i love this  brush for foundation it&amp;#39;s one of my  favorites  and i&amp;#39;m just going to  put this  all over my face  i think this is the foundation i&amp;#39;m gonna  get the full size of because i think  it&amp;#39;s gonna be great  for winter  so  this might be the one i get we&amp;#39;ll have  to see i just love  like i said in one of my other videos  you can just totally tell the difference  between  high-end foundations and drugstore  foundations like when they&amp;#39;re on your  skin it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s insane  how different  they are and if i sound a little  different or if i cough a lot or  something i am getting kind of sick i  like rarely get sick but  ever since i started dating  colton  um every time he gets sick he like  passes it on to me so now i&amp;#39;m going to  take this dermablend concealer this is  insable you&amp;#39;ve seen this so many times  in my videos because i use it literally  all the time  apply a little bit of this on my cheeks  just a tiny bit  cover up any extra redness peeking  through  using that same brush  just going to put that  on my cheeks and blend it out  i just love this foundation it looks so  nice you guys if you haven&amp;#39;t tried the  makeup forever matte velvet plush you  should because it&amp;#39;s really nice  i like a little toothpaste on it lip  lips sorry  and in the camera it looks or in the  viewfinder doesn&amp;#39;t look like my neck  matches my face but i think it&amp;#39;s just  the lighting because  it does match but bronzer will help that  um going to do my under eye concealer i  use this all the time the rimmel match  perfection concealer and light i&amp;#39;m gonna  use this today  and i love this stuff i love it so good  so placing that  underneath my eyes a little bit of a  triangle  you can blend that my fingers  under eye concealer is on just going to  blend a little bit like with the tip of  this brush  and then i&amp;#39;m going to take of course the  makeup forever hd powder love this stuff  a lot of you are telling me  maybe i won&amp;#39;t be using that because i  really don&amp;#39;t feel like getting up the  lush emotional brilliance powder i  haven&amp;#39;t used this in forever  so that&amp;#39;s what it looks like showed in a  haul or i didn&amp;#39;t show it in a haul  because i didn&amp;#39;t get it in my bag but  i&amp;#39;m gonna be using this  to set  my under eye concealer and also just go  ahead and set my face stuff so  um  take it  and  pat away oh crap i just like  poured a buttload that&amp;#39;s the only thing  i hate this does not have a sifter at  all so  it&amp;#39;s one of those things that just  pisses you off when you try to work with  it maybe that&amp;#39;s why i haven&amp;#39;t used it so  long peg powder brush and i&amp;#39;m just going  to  put this all over this is a great matte  powder if it had a sifter it&amp;#39;d be  perfect  and  if you have the makeup forever powder  does anyone else think it smells weird i  think it smells kind of weird  that might be  the only one but  it smells weird  okay i&amp;#39;m going to take my chanel soleil  10-day chanel bronzer this is what it  looks like  and there&amp;#39;s the back in case you&amp;#39;re  wondering about names and stuff  this is what it looks like it&amp;#39;s like a  cream bronzer but if you have oily skin  i&amp;#39;ve said this before don&amp;#39;t be scared of  it because it&amp;#39;s not going to like be  super creamy  but this sort of goes on and it sort of  dries to a powder it doesn&amp;#39;t look like a  cream at all it&amp;#39;s very natural very very  pretty um for this bronzer i&amp;#39;m using  this  crown brush contour brush or contour  blush whatever i&amp;#39;m gonna use it for  bronzer um a little bit of this stuff  does go a long way so every time i swirl  my brush and the product i will tap off  excess and then i&amp;#39;ll just start applying  it where i would usually like apply like  a contour why is my ear so red you guys  see that um but i&amp;#39;ll apply this where i  usually apply my contour so  right here  and i&amp;#39;ll just drag it up the side of my  face and go to the top of my forehead  and it&amp;#39;s just a really nice natural  bronzer like i&amp;#39;m obsessed with it can  you tell the difference  i love it so again  tap off excess and just  kind of contour with it  okay  now i&amp;#39;m just going to  kind of buff out that contour  just so it doesn&amp;#39;t look too harsh with  this crown brush brush i don&amp;#39;t know what  it&amp;#39;s called  um doesn&amp;#39;t have a name on it but that&amp;#39;s  what it looks like it&amp;#39;s like a big brush  for brush you can use any sort of big  dense brush and it&amp;#39;ll work fine  so  there we go  that&amp;#39;s better right yep  okay and i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and do blush  and for today&amp;#39;s blush i&amp;#39;m gonna be using  the nars dan mori palette this is sin  it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite colors from nars  i&amp;#39;m obsessed with it so this is the  color i&amp;#39;ll be using  and i&amp;#39;m just going to apply that  on my cheeks  this is one of the colors that i would  go out by the full size of because i  love it so much especially for fall and  winter  it&amp;#39;s really pretty  okay now for eyes i&amp;#39;m gonna zoom you  guys in okay so i&amp;#39;m going to take  soft ochre from mac  i&amp;#39;m going to prime my eyes  and i have four mac shades that i&amp;#39;m  going to be using today i&amp;#39;ll go ahead  and show you them  um  we have  omega  saddle which i used to talk about all  the time  got espresso  and antique which is a really pretty  color especially for fall so  those are the kind of colors i&amp;#39;ll be  using today and the first one i&amp;#39;m going  to take is  saddle from mac and i&amp;#39;m going to take a  blending brush  i&amp;#39;m just going to put this in my crease  like a transition color  i hope you guys can see this  okay and then we&amp;#39;re going to take um  antiqued  so we&amp;#39;re just going to take a flat  shader brush that kind of looks like  that  this is the sigma e55 and we&amp;#39;re going to  take antiqued  which is this color and i&amp;#39;m going to  apply this sort of from the middle of my  eye to the outer  part to the outer v so  just pour it in the middle and i&amp;#39;ll  apply it all over that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll do  so apply this color  kind of lightly  all over the lid  i always end up changing my mind like  right when i&amp;#39;m doing something then i&amp;#39;m  going to take an angle brush  like  this  nice angle brush taking  from mac  and take that angle brush  and just deepen out the outer v  then we&amp;#39;re going to  blend blem blend i know i keep looking  the viewfinder but i&amp;#39;m trying to try to  see if i&amp;#39;m in here and if i&amp;#39;m if you  guys can see what i&amp;#39;m doing because last  time you guys really wanted me to  zoom in more i&amp;#39;m not going to zoom in  really closely on like when i do face  products because i kind of feel like  that&amp;#39;s pointless but  everything else like eyes and stuff i&amp;#39;ll  zoom in on  so that&amp;#39;s what it looks like i&amp;#39;m going  to take just a little bit of omega  so just a little bit of omega i&amp;#39;m just  going to kind of take this right above  where saddle ends  i&amp;#39;m really quickly going to take  brulee from wet and wild see this is  like  one of those videos that you just do it  as you go but i like those kinds of  videos right  so this is brulee it&amp;#39;s a nice matte  cream color from wet n wild i&amp;#39;m gonna  put this right underneath my brow  this is a gorgeous highlight  great for drugstore wet n wild is so  pigmented  and it&amp;#39;s definitely worth trying out if  you&amp;#39;ve never tried them before putting  this in my inner corner  it&amp;#39;s really like the inner part of the  lid too just to brighten it up some  all right and now we&amp;#39;re going to take  the l&amp;#39;oreal hip liner talk about this a  lot  so it looks like going to line  my  waterline  now taking my favorite liquid liner this  is the rimmel exaggerate liner  that&amp;#39;s what it looks like i&amp;#39;ve been  completely obsessed with it and of  course what am i gonna do i&amp;#39;m gonna do a  winged liner  so  really quickly going to take this pencil  brush  taking um expresso from mac i&amp;#39;m going to  smudge this underneath my bottom lash  line then we&amp;#39;re going to curl our lashes  and apply some mascara i&amp;#39;ll have a  mascara routine video up  soon if i don&amp;#39;t have it up now if i have  it up now i&amp;#39;ll link it in this video  because there&amp;#39;s no point you see me do  my mascara if i&amp;#39;ve already done a video  on it so  oh okay

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.319" dur="4.421">hey guys this is fertile poker VIP  welcome to part 2 of our cash game  series over uncle&amp;#39;s poker fight a mix of  2250 and hell I just this is a direct  continuation from part one if anyone  hasn&amp;#39;t seen that feel free to do so you  can see how we have the playing so far  and anywhere any kind of specific Reed&amp;#39;s  that you have any of the players here  will of all been garnered in part one so  if you want to check that out feel free  to do so but they will of course be  standalone episodes so there&amp;#39;s no  obligation to do that at a station  offsuit on the top right table we&amp;#39;re  happy to bring this in for an open we  got three about unfortunately we&amp;#39;re  gonna have to let this go  it sucks here cuz this guy he&amp;#39;s a half  stocker and he&amp;#39;s just kind of calling  and then calling again he&amp;#39;s almost  certainly gonna be one of the weaker  players so we definitely want to get  involved with pots against him we have a  queen out of the small blind we&amp;#39;re gonna  be three betting Don Lemon he&amp;#39;s been one  of the more aggressive players so far  this session so we have potentially  gonna be going to war if we three bet  any for bets it&amp;#39;s not really an that I&amp;#39;m  planning on folding kbits we don&amp;#39;t  really have any read up we have the no  pair we&amp;#39;re gonna start this off with a  check out of check Cole pretty difficult  board until connected that&amp;#39;s strongly  with a turn we take the need against his  9x we&amp;#39;re afraid of king X obviously and  now we are afraid of 10x  don&amp;#39;t envision waves folding here will  see his son will see a sizing if he  doesn&amp;#39;t like to bash I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re  applying unfolding I mean I think I was  particularly enormous wheedle considers  but I mean if it does go enormous it  just curve looks as somewhat bloody so I  think we were we&amp;#39;re planning on calling  down there versus most size and he did  in fact half the night so we got a  little look six Jack offsuit people let  go and okay suited on the button it&amp;#39;s  reasonably playable this guy he&amp;#39;s got  some chips he might feel a little bit  more frivolous than you might normally  would so we&amp;#39;re happy to see pots in  position against him see if we can make  a strong hand and look to play a big  part definite borderline call sucks that  we got to squeeze behind we&amp;#39;re not  getting the worst of prices whoops I  said I called the call of a single raise  is my limit here at the king in suit it  was margin the best year for facing the  three bet I think we&amp;#39;re just gonna let  it go  I wanna get four bet it&amp;#39;s obviously very  even more trivial will open the pocket  threes though on the top right table we  take down the blinds a seven no good  nine straight off of it  potential pop ruin here in the a  sideboard when it goes three way and you  see bets no just bet fold fold no action  five Jack in the big blind of soup not  much we&amp;#39;re gonna be able to do here  forget a walk that would be fantastic  hey six suited we will bring this in for  an open definitely don&amp;#39;t mind us take  another blinds here we see a flop  well fired a single at least one bet  here in this flop with the potential to  fire on multiple violence we do not have  to that Queen would have been a card I&amp;#39;d  be bargaining for sure and King trial  suits we will fill ace deuce is gonna be  good enough to open for the cutoff uh  ten three on the bottom right table we  will just be letting this one go even  face the minute open like obvious we&amp;#39;re  getting a very good price so it&amp;#39;s  obviously you&amp;#39;re completely trashy and  ace queen of the small almost certainly  gonna be playing this one  okay tapas this guy just let calls which  is the sign indicative of a weaker  player it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely he is one of  the better players for sure when he&amp;#39;s  just name calling there because he was  just like you I&amp;#39;m calling on the button  as well which is just something you  should just you should never do it&amp;#39;s I  mean if you&amp;#39;ve got a hand that&amp;#39;s good  enough to play just bring it in for a  race there&amp;#39;s so much inherent value in  just taking down the blinds even if you  even if you have like even if you&amp;#39;re  trapping with allegations or something  like that there&amp;#39;s just so much inherent  value not allowing your opponent to see  your free flop and you just just a good  standard obviously never never open them  not alone with this ten at all this  sizing is kind of tilting  all right Bufo old youth old oops too  many by rivers for us if we do billions  like it obviously we don&amp;#39;t look the best  time there very often anyway there&amp;#39;s  just not that many good cards first on  the river take Queen we will let go also  we well the seven six potential action  border but the top left table obviously  a lot of potential to strong hands  possible there but no no significant  action going it 7:6 offsuit open the top  left table not read much we&amp;#39;re going to  be able to do here if this goes multi  way we will consider seeing a flop it&amp;#39;s  still gonna be close this guy calls me  definitely called I guess so I guess  we&amp;#39;re calling either way bush life here  being at a position just looks hard and  this fact three bets that makes it much  easier decision for us and the six seven  over here when it&amp;#39;s not a multi-way posh  we just let it go  obviously it&amp;#39;s a button open so it&amp;#39;s a  bit of a weak arrange all range but it&amp;#39;s  still gonna be very very tricky to turn  a profit there okay pocket fives easy  open blind versus blind take down the  blinds no harm no fell okay we&amp;#39;re gonna  call and take flop here although  squeezing is actually quite attractive  let&amp;#39;s go for the squeeze instead  so not shocked this guy calls but this  is the guy I mean this has happened at  once already where he&amp;#39;s just gonna call  and just give it up easily on the flop  so let&amp;#39;s hope he does it again we&amp;#39;re  gonna see we&amp;#39;re gonna fire one and done  here and a lot of words and obviously we  can potentially just hit a sneaky-ass  strong hand as well not in love with  life that this guy is stuck arranged  we are gonna bet this board though I had  no reason to go particularly larger I  think this will get the job done for the  most parts and we have a sneaky very  strong I&amp;#39;m gonna the top right table I  was gonna go all-in and hope he has the  tent never take down the bottom right  table which we love actually checking  here might have been better cuz he  always bets it ends right and he might  blow yeah check checking that was those  a mistake checking would be better there  cuz he never checks back to straight and  if we do check and he has like for  example with diamonds is it&amp;#39;s entirely  possible that he that he elects for a  bluff so we want to give him that  opportunity so that that all-in was bad  actually that was that I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t  think through my options there it&amp;#39;s  amazing like hey I mean like a you know  take millions of hands of Poker but  still like just just little small  setback just take an extra like three or  four seconds of things for your options  it can make a huge difference to your  winners like obviously those kind of  situations they don&amp;#39;t come up all that  often but if you play them just a little  bit better every single time it does  make it it adds up but it makes a pretty  big difference so I&amp;#39;m annoyed at myself  that hey these things happened we&amp;#39;re not  gonna it&amp;#39;s not gonna be the first  mistake I&amp;#39;ll make it&amp;#39;s not gonna be the  last sorry it&amp;#39;s not the first mistake  should I say I certainly won&amp;#39;t be the  last  that&amp;#39;s nice 7 suited one got rid the  coat off we&amp;#39;re happy to bring in for an  open  we take it down I King Jack will be  going for the open again I rested under  the golden arches like this we&amp;#39;ll go  yeah we can&amp;#39;t consider three betting  here but folding versus month ago to  open seems reasonably prudent as well 10  Jack suited in the bottom-left table we  shall bring it in and we got three bets  here we will see the flop here he&amp;#39;s made  quite small I&amp;#39;m getting over 2 2 1 our  money and we have a hand that has the  potential to flop quite well and we get  to go multi-way so that&amp;#39;s added gravy  okay we would like if there&amp;#39;s at least  one Spade here but we have the open  ender so that&amp;#39;s pretty good we&amp;#39;re  getting an exceptionally good price here  so we will certainly be seeing a turn  so our options here now are to go for  the check or we can also lead we are  going to go for the check  I&amp;#39;m gonna go for the big over right here  and expected to fold a nice pretty often  we just wrap a flow here so hard  Oh whoops heinous the top to burrow but  honestly I would have expect he seems  like a more of a rakish player so I  wouldn&amp;#39;t expect him to throw those types  of hands books cuz it&amp;#39;s kinda it&amp;#39;s just  how it&amp;#39;s hard for us to have that many  gloves there so when the over back we  just incredibly noted but obviously he  has the Queen blocker which is quite  good for him like he blocks our full  heads and stuff like that as well but we  can definitely be playing we can  definitely have solutions that take that  line so I think if he I was like hey  Stan he&amp;#39;s jack stuff like that he almost  certainly folds the ace queen is  probably just a little bit too strong  but hey no harm no foul who loses think  that was a 30 euro bash plus whatever so  we use like 35 40 you&amp;#39;re almost to buy  in but not the end of the world  that&amp;#39;s probably put us down for this  session  yeah we&amp;#39;re certainly down a little bit  for the session I was hopefully maybe  had to get it back before we kick back  off the King 10 we will be going for the  open up on the top right tail we&amp;#39;re  gonna call with the fives after we take  it down to content will be open to a 7 I  bet the board for pocket fives or some  enough fold into a single that we pick  up and open under to go along with our  pair sure bad about you will call it  again thanks pretty good it should  really shut him down I feel like if he  does I had like tens Jack&amp;#39;s queens  anything like that it should really  showed him down here so if we triple  borrows I will be suspicious I&amp;#39;ll be  suspicious to say the least  he does slow down which is I mean if he  if he&amp;#39;d bet big there I don&amp;#39;t know we  would have been a tricky spot I don&amp;#39;t  think we were planning on folding I had  we decided to peel one off here with no  hair and the good shot to the notice  when we even the kindest it seems kind  of reductive for me do flush we hit our  ace with that what he just bets  absolutely massive there on the diamond  it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just a spot where it&amp;#39;s  really hard for us to be ahead it&amp;#39;s kind  of hard for him to have that many gloves  against the designed here like he bet  this flop and then he just bonds  eternity bombs it absolutely enormous as  well so he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s just committed  himself and I just don&amp;#39;t envision him  doing that with like you know if he is a  king queen or something like that maybe  first king queen isn&amp;#39;t the queen of  diamond that the king of king or queen  of diamonds or something to that effect  it&amp;#39;s possible but overall they expect us  to be in trouble there quite frequently  and it&amp;#39;s really hard from the out like a  stone cold Bluff there so just letting  her hand go seems more prudent to Levin  and not okay we peels this turn every  second people a flop brother I&amp;#39;m just  gonna bet quite small here just we&amp;#39;re  just gonna protect around a little bit  because look that value for my case X  that I picked up a good show zone it was  like a nice tanner something like that  there&amp;#39;s a pretty decent shot see calls  with overs and a good shush  and qui 10 we just let this little girl  nine five on the button not much you&amp;#39;re  going to be able to do nine six suited  in the big blind over the top left table  as definitely some potential will defend  here ideally we&amp;#39;d like to see this go  multi way if it doesn&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ll just let  it go  they don&amp;#39;t fall suited cards is that  often versus number two gone open though  who&amp;#39;s got that little bit of a stronger  range it&amp;#39;s fine as I said if that goes  multi way we&amp;#39;re definitely we&amp;#39;re  definitely peeling and taking a flop in  a position or no King seminar super yet  tonight go at deuce three we&amp;#39;re not  gonna be doing anything here other than  folding pocket kings let&amp;#39;s see if we can  get a little pot Brown here I can clean  up in the top left table definitely  wouldn&amp;#39;t mind a little bit of action  here either I&amp;#39;ll go for the three but  here in the bottom obviously we want to  see player four bring in a large squeeze  which doesn&amp;#39;t do K board obviously sets  our concern and you know has like eight  nine but overall not the worst of words  but any stretch the imagination  not a boy word forever gonna be all that  comfortable like we get if we bet you  get raised here we&amp;#39;re kind of sad but  there are a decent number of hands that  kind of definitely just call which is  what we want don&amp;#39;t mind seeing this at  all  we&amp;#39;ve got a full house down in the  bottom right table obviously one of the  weaker phil has is a weaker possible to  flop we&amp;#39;re pretty much just some jet  come out here for the most part I had  the five we like a lot there&amp;#39;s one  written to e3 potentially take this down  and fold them off at shop with like a  really large over it  this guy bets quite large which is  annoying as hell I&amp;#39;m not a fan I&amp;#39;ve just  called him for jumps no I had this jack  I mean it&amp;#39;s good and bad so you can have  ten Jack which is good he could have  like a nine Jack as well which is bad  oh no inquiry we&amp;#39;re just gonna we&amp;#39;re  just gonna ship it in if he has a hand  looking call he&amp;#39;s gonna call most  sizings we&amp;#39;re not playing I&amp;#39;ve told him  if he bets himself so might as well look  to punish him as much as possible the  only thing going for smaller size in  there would be if he has I&amp;#39;m the case in  nine maybe he calls a smaller size but  overall I&amp;#39;m I prefer just going from  it&amp;#39;s fine election weekend weekend  occasionally I hear up there my second  parents don&amp;#39;t like that anyway so we&amp;#39;re  not automatically giving up the pot if  he just says like ace nine and stuff  like that and as I said ten Jack will  make up a reasonable part of his range  there when he calls to streets having  the open ended with overs so we want to  make sure we punish him when he has  River duck top parrot I panic  obviously sucks if he has a hand like to  pair like nine Jack or something like  that that gets there in the river but as  I said if if he has that we&amp;#39;re gonna be  using a large bet anyway if we check or  if we bet small and he jams like we&amp;#39;re  never folding anyway and I presume any  jams all those two pairs pluses if we do  bet smaller so it doesn&amp;#39;t really change  too much the ACE for we like to go on  the bottom due to the air in a position  open by eight  a queen under the gun obviously no good  neither is the deuce 4 4 7 8 Oh suit in  the cutoff we&amp;#39;re not planning on  bringing that in a full suit we  obviously open - Brooks offsuit variety  we&amp;#39;re happy just to let it go  a stray in the big blind we shall see  how the action develops there are some  scenarios where we like to play this  might use it was a three that Bluff here  if the blunt goes for the open which he  does your 5 has already gone for the 3  met those so I guess we let these guys  battle it out  looks like we&amp;#39;re about to see a flop  here at the for 5o suit oh that would  have been a pretty decent flop for us I  was sneaky without a man it would have  been extremely undisguised  okay ace Jack pretty strong attention to  play and let&amp;#39;s see take a flop here at  the 45 a flat bottom pair with depending  on the sizing we make sure : Street  that&amp;#39;s a really bad turn for a really  bad turn not a huge fan of cold calling  three bets here but given this guy is  propensity to call and see well to it  like see see flops like that I expect us  cultivate really frequently and I&amp;#39;m okay  I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not like an amazing  scenario but taking a check is fine  where this guy seems to be on the  slightly more aggressive side you&amp;#39;ve  seen him three about a few hands now and  so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not like he&amp;#39;s just  kind of limited to not at hands it&amp;#39;s  just a case now or they want to make a  play at this board I think I do so let&amp;#39;s  make it four ready to go this is very  much just a one and done bet unless we  manage to beat that ace that you don&amp;#39;t  okay but on my table we have picked up  top two pair there is a potential flush  neither we just fell liked our opponent  obviously what&amp;#39;s referred to get more  action there it&amp;#39;s not the word where I&amp;#39;m  ever gonna be still playing really  though I&amp;#39;m happy just to go ahead and  bet okay nine ten suited we are going to  flat Co this is the same flare that we  run our large bluff on earlier on so  there are some scenarios where we can  over bet quite liberty for value and  expect to get called a bit lighter  unfortunately but work does not allow us  to see the flop so we aren&amp;#39;t going to  have two folds face jutsu is an art size  although we are a reason big deep  wouldn&amp;#39;t have been obscene to cold take  a block there but I&amp;#39;d be pretty  surprised if returning a profit by doing  so and one of the worst flops imaginable  for the pocket raise we just let this  will go there are some boards where we  will continue without hitting our set  but the basic aim for ain&amp;#39;t one of them  okay coming ten sue down the bottom left  table let&amp;#39;s see if we can see a  multi-way flop which you can flap top  pair okay kicker far from a disaster  please spots the where our kicker isn&amp;#39;t  reading all that red ons because it&amp;#39;s  pretty unlikely they&amp;#39;ve got like that  many Queen I or Queen eight or worse  okay I&amp;#39;m just gonna wait you&amp;#39;re here now  and probably bet most rivers to gonna  get value from like pocket jacks pocket  eights pocket tens but also we block it  that cut those types of hands we get one  fold dart Elaine because he checked back  this flop were not really afraid of any  I got on the vision I&amp;#39;m ever checking  back a better Queen and I don&amp;#39;t really  envision him still playing sets or  anything like that that board and I&amp;#39;m  will tear apart either so when this  Joe&amp;#39;s checked through I expect that the  best time there the Queen Amina  frequently and you know our hands  there&amp;#39;s way more bad cards than good  cards for hands there&amp;#39;s no real there&amp;#39;s  no value really and in not betting  they&amp;#39;re just allow two opponents of free  opportunity to catch up Bay City okay we  flop the toughest of the pair&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s  the toughest of the kicker&amp;#39;s up on the  top right table and fortunately now  actually know obviously aboard we were  really hoping to get paid  I&amp;#39;m you married looking to get stocks it  or anything like it&amp;#39;s pretty difficult  to get you know a single parent for  stocks in a single raise partly a hinge  boat we were gonna be looking for  multiple streets of body obviously okay  queen eight blind versus blind when we  do not fold we flop a second pair live  up to bear obviously the two pair isn&amp;#39;t  all that great and we improved to better  two-parent we have three paradigm wears  been a cold in here he has the a side of  the king nice hand sir nice hand I don&amp;#39;t  think we can really do too much  different there we&amp;#39;re getting two to one  with the Queen eight blind versus blind  versus a very wide range so Queen H is  going to be doing well enough to hold  getting such a good price when we&amp;#39;ve got  the pair they&amp;#39;re on the ACA sex George  we you know we can&amp;#39;t fall to a single  bet for sure  turn betting turn would have been a  mistake and then river I mean I don&amp;#39;t  think we can ever fill my reader so  happy with how it played it all right  and at least nine we opened up in the  top right to Queen four in the bottom  left we let go Don Lemon has been  getting at the better it was so far this  session all of Oliver we were doing  quite well all of our profit has been  going that way move around the big  bluefin him over at the bottom left  table earlier on where he had East the  Queen and we had the Miss straight row  and he&amp;#39;s been definitely getting the  better of us I&amp;#39;ve never find a saying  which they may not asleep it click the  ten Jack had was you know necessarily  necessarily Bluff I always hate that  term though where there&amp;#39;s something is  necessary and I felt to be profitable  I still do feeling to be profitable I  mean without the Queen without blocking  that those extra full houses I know how  to be surprised if he calls there were  just a lonely spot maybe it does I mean  Ice Queen isn&amp;#39;t all that different like  the hands I&amp;#39;m wrapping ace Queen who&amp;#39;s  doing a justice like if you were of them  a favor play Queens that way but  I think I think he can fold a nice there  pretty frequently so I&amp;#39;m okay with it  okay we&amp;#39;re gonna go for the three but  here this guy has been reasonably active  so far so we&amp;#39;re obviously wrapping quite  strong here with this kind of hand but  3-betting it from under the gun plus 1  we get the respect we deserve all right  we have open to the a stray we flap top  hair with the backdoor flush draw  bedding here it doesn&amp;#39;t really  accomplish too much it loves the posh  which we&amp;#39;re not really a fan of doing in  this with this kind of kind of type of  hand strength and purely because it&amp;#39;s  you know if we do better if we better  and get cold we&amp;#39;re against essentially  flush draws or battery sex primarily so  when we check more fun things could  happen we can we can induce some Bluffs  so he is like you know king queen here  something like that he might just elect  to stab and I guess we&amp;#39;re just gonna  check hold here again betting for value  seems incredibly optimistic like I don&amp;#39;t  imagine a pad like a so here at King  Knight get 10 9  Jack Knight anything that calls his  pocket queens because I mean maybe if  maybe that exact time calls perhaps I&amp;#39;m  kind of surprised you didn&amp;#39;t three bet  that free that seems bad feel like he  should absolutely be three betting that  hand as six nine soon if this guy is  essentially been open so we&amp;#39;re starting  off folding we&amp;#39;re not in love with this  Queen but we don&amp;#39;t hate it  enough that we&amp;#39;re just going to check  fold so we are going to call and see a  river the jack we don&amp;#39;t like either a  few bets again we let this one go  I didn&amp;#39;t want to see a diamond that we  didn&amp;#39;t want to see a Broadway card  pretty kits there we call that River but  I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he did cope quite large  but I still still think we&amp;#39;re gonna make  that call and the jack though there&amp;#39;s  just some extra cards although maybe  he&amp;#39;s not really gonna be betting us  Jack&amp;#39;s there so maybe I&amp;#39;m maybe only  correct in saying that but overall I  think letting letting the third pair go  they&amp;#39;re facing a large river bed it&amp;#39;s  going to be absolutely fine we have been  spewing a little bit of chips here on  this table you might need to tighten up  a little bit  we&amp;#39;ve only got like four or five more  minutes left to go so let&amp;#39;s see if we  can think ourselves at decent pot and  again ourselves a day say where we&amp;#39;re  down somewhere in the ballpark of 20  euro ish since we started this so all of  that could be a camera work with that  barge people think you&amp;#39;d go Mike just oh  alright three five suits we may append  we may like to play this if this goes  multi waving will it doesn&amp;#39;t go it&amp;#39;s  kind of hardware doesn&amp;#39;t really warrant  playing in a heads-up hush whereas multi  way you&amp;#39;ve stopped more likely to get  paid when you do fruit 8 6 suited we  will be bring this in for an open if the  court opens I&amp;#39;m happy to call take a  flop in position  don&amp;#39;t want to see you squeeze we don&amp;#39;t  really like okay leaf up a pair of six  in the window always nice to see or  certainly not folding I raisin will be  somewhat suicidal here though how many  checks still say I&amp;#39;m gonna better that  said I round a little bit just for  protection there are quite a number of  bad turned cards for us and that&amp;#39;s not I  mean it&amp;#39;s not the best obviously was  certainly not the worst and I&amp;#39;d imagine  he bets swooshed Rose here if he flops  it so you could just bet three streets  here I mean I&amp;#39;m not really afraid of  many 9x here so I&amp;#39;m gonna bet here in  look to get called by King can&amp;#39;t really  go that large given what this fortress  straight on the board just hope it does  not King nine but even if you ask a  night I don&amp;#39;t imagine he raises here  with the flush on board so we value on  ourselves a little bit versus that exact  time but he had like king queen king  Jack anything like that then I would  imagine we see a call here pretty  frequently  get the full through so he certainly  isn&amp;#39;t folding a better hat about to  Paradise we did of the best hunt almost  certainly so we were correct in going  good buddy thank my overall thought  process is finding the way it&amp;#39;s as I  said it&amp;#39;s very difficult for him to have  a mind and ace and an ace let&amp;#39;s see if  we can get some actually only we just  take down the blinds definitely not what  we wanted to take it for our suit looks  we&amp;#39;re gonna be able to do here and the  King Trey blind versus blind we will go  for the steal hopefully he just Falls if  he calls I mean it&amp;#39;s not a disaster we  don&amp;#39;t get through that though we do not  call or for bet King tree off suit we&amp;#39;ve  been getting fairly abused with three  bets this session so far we&amp;#39;ve been  getting badly abused actually possibly  should have sprinkled in some more in  liked for bets but we haven&amp;#39;t really had  many good hands to do with I&amp;#39;ve got a  fairly well-defined for betting  arrangement just happened to happen  haven&amp;#39;t happened to have any of them in  the situations where we&amp;#39;ve gotten three  bed queen Jack student we will like to  bring this in for three bets if it was  if there was any open before us but  there wasn&amp;#39;t so we just open it  ourselves  obviously we will call we&amp;#39;re not folding  this to a three bet depending on the  size in here where I&amp;#39;d like you to see a  turn if you get was like really baked  we&amp;#39;ll just let it go but if he goes a  kind of half polish yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna  coat we pick up a good shush it&amp;#39;s not a  fantastically good card for solar and  though if he does fired again here I  guess we&amp;#39;re just gonna let this one go  and not the flop we want to do with Jack  and the jack up in the top  left table so buddy checks here twice I  do magic we have the best time pretty  frequently but it&amp;#39;s just good like  getting paid but like sevens eights  nines stuff like that just seems like  it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen all that often so  we&amp;#39;re just gonna check if he bets we  have a really annoying decision so we  did with the best hand I would assume  he&amp;#39;s gonna have a pocket pair there very  often but not we just Chuck and the  Queen pretty loose call and kind of  surprised when people check back there I  expect him to have shown in value kind  of surprised he&amp;#39;s got like just no  showing a lot so ever I think usually  people are kind of confident enough that  they realize they need to take a stab  oh well hey that&amp;#39;s been me guys I hope  you have enjoyed the session obviously  not a fantastic result for us but  overall I&amp;#39;m happy with how it played  through we don&amp;#39;t the only reason we lost  was because of any single hand  essentially towards the end the session  maybe we played a little bit possibly at  certain spots but overall I&amp;#39;m happy I  feel that we played it pretty well and  overall you know it is what it is if you  have any questions comments queries  about any of the hands that we&amp;#39;ve played  for you&amp;#39;re free to fire them at me I do  is monitor the social media like YouTube  or VIP forums etc so if you&amp;#39;ve any  questions queries about any of the hands  feel free to let me know I don&amp;#39;t do my  best to get back to you I hope you have  enjoyed what you&amp;#39;ve seen I will chat you  all soon guys that take care and have a  good day</text><text start="2.79" dur="4.79"></text><text start="4.74" dur="5.52"></text><text start="7.58" dur="4.389"></text><text start="10.26" dur="3.39"></text><text start="11.969"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.04" dur="5.68">hey guys so today i&amp;#39;m going to try to do  a little bit better attempt at um  showing you how to recycle candles um  the downside with some of the recycling  is that you&amp;#39;re not necessarily going to  achieve um a nice perfect clean wax  because as you can see  there&amp;#39;s um  definitely like some soot in there from  the wick  so i mean this isn&amp;#39;t gonna be  something that&amp;#39;s like  a perfected technique or anything but um  you know just when you get these larger  candles there is quite a bit of waste  for example  i had this one in the container and i  accidentally broke the container but  this was made up of like maybe  um  four candles five candles  and as you can see the wax pour is not  real great it&amp;#39;s kind of layered because  um  i did this over a period of time  and i&amp;#39;m gonna re-melt it today and make  new candles out of it since i broke the  container  but this is like all sandalwood citrus  and ocean side so you can like  um for bath and body works  so you can like make new um scents and  stuff with it  with all that wax waste that you get  so um i&amp;#39;ve got a few of the sandalwood  citrus so i&amp;#39;m gonna try  my best to hold the phone  and um  show you what i&amp;#39;m doing  so  actually i think i might go set that  there okay  so what i&amp;#39;m doing is i&amp;#39;m taking the  tongs these are just regular kitchen  tongs with like a rubber handle  and i&amp;#39;m grabbing the edge  of the container  and um  i&amp;#39;m taking like a hot pad you know use  oven mitt type thing for the bottom to  hold it as i pour  and i&amp;#39;m going to try my best to pour  as quickly and evenly as possible into  the new container  which i&amp;#39;ve already placed to wick in  and um  ideally  you find a way to secure the wick i  tried to get as much of the black stuff  out of there as i could  um ideally i have like a whole  set up with like popsicle sticks and  stuff but i just got done moving and i&amp;#39;m  still trying to  find things so um  i don&amp;#39;t have my popsicle sticks at the  moment so i&amp;#39;m going to just  try to find  actually these tongs double really well  for that kind of thing but i&amp;#39;m going to  be needing them so i&amp;#39;m not going to do  that  but that&amp;#39;s an option  so we see we&amp;#39;re going to find something  we can use  just for a second while i do that  because you want to stabilize the wick  as best you can  that&amp;#39;s not gonna work either because um  otherwise you get slanting in there and  you&amp;#39;re not gonna have a good nice even  burn and you get some slack in the wick  once you add hot wax  so you definitely want to make sure  you find a way to stabilize the wick as  best you can and unfortunately  i didn&amp;#39;t think this through and i&amp;#39;m not  having a whole lot of luck so let me see  if i can  work either  i have popsicle sticks that like have a  hole drilled in the middle and then i  use like um clothes pit wooden clothes  pins  and those  work probably the best without having to  go into anything expensive or buying the  actual they&amp;#39;re essentially the same  thick thing as the uh like wick  stabilizers you can buy that are the  metal ones  you can buy those for candle making  but um  so basically  well that&amp;#39;s sitting there i&amp;#39;m doing  another one  so you just want to fill i actually  filled this up a little bit higher than  i typically do because  i&amp;#39;ve got some um  candles that i&amp;#39;m still  like  like this one i&amp;#39;ve got to melt because i  tried to redo this and like not do it  the right way and my wicks got buried so  i need to do it properly this head broke  and i tried to squeeze  the back and body works handle from an  old jar i know in your jar and it didn&amp;#39;t  work out well so um  i put it back in the boiling water and  just wait for a while for it to melt  you can kind of  once you start getting the wax pulling  around the edge if you want to hurry it  along  and kind of like push the wax down and  like  let it seep up over the sides  it&amp;#39;ll help it um kind of speed it up  so  um once you get the water boiling it  really doesn&amp;#39;t take a  whole lot of time  and i can even  tip it and do that  try to get the hot wax over the rest of  it and make it melt a little faster  it only takes you know  a couple minutes to get them melted if  you have a larger pot you could always  do that so you can do like more than one  at once  um  i guess i could have done that but  my hot pads aren&amp;#39;t very big  so um  i don&amp;#39;t get an even distribution of heat  if i do that  so hopefully  this will melt quickly  but um anyway well that&amp;#39;s doing that  um i go to um  i go to various like resale stores  because i was doing candle making for a  little while but uh it turned out to not  be really  uh profitable to do so um now i use a  lot of the stuff for recycling  and i&amp;#39;ll go find things you know people  have dropped off at resale places and um  i picked containers up that would be  good for candles  these are  excuse me ikea cups like teacups  and these wicks you can buy them at  pretty any pretty much any craft store  or you can buy them online  you can do one of a couple of things to  secure the wick to the bottom you can  see this is a little off-center you can  either use they make like this wick  um like it&amp;#39;s a putty in a in a little  round  container and you like roll that between  your fingers and stick  the base of the wick  to the bottom  and let it dry or you can use um like a  a like craft  elmer&amp;#39;s makes like a craft uh glue that  you can use with ceramics  and that works pretty good i haven&amp;#39;t had  any trouble with that either so um  i find all these different containers or  like if they put things on clearance  like that  um  i&amp;#39;ll use those kind of containers this  was actually supposed to be like a  display for um  you put like a little boutique in there  or something but i&amp;#39;m actually gonna use  it to fill it up  so  it looks like our wax is pretty much  getting there  melted wise so  i&amp;#39;m at like seven minutes into the video  and i&amp;#39;ve already  gotten my second one done so  that kind of gives you a good gauge of  how long  this takes per  you know per uh carton i guess but also  keep in mind that since these are  there&amp;#39;s less wax in these  it&amp;#39;s going to take a lot less time than  when i&amp;#39;m going to try to do that ski  lodge one for math and body works  so let&amp;#39;s uh go over here again  get ready for our second pour  i&amp;#39;m gonna move the knife  and hopefully i&amp;#39;ll have i won&amp;#39;t run out  or run out of space in there rather  again  try to go as evenly as possible  quickly as possible  voila  so now that&amp;#39;ll probably take  it really depends on how long it takes  to cool with a smaller container like  this it&amp;#39;ll probably take a couple of  hours for it to really solidify but i  would recommend  um just kind of leaving them be  overnight  because that way um  you can sort of ensure  that nothing&amp;#39;s gonna be accidentally  like because if you move it too soon or  do anything you&amp;#39;re gonna get these kind  of like little divots and really the  proper way you&amp;#39;re supposed to do it is  you&amp;#39;re supposed to like save a little  bit of extra wax to be able to fill kind  of fill that in but  um  i&amp;#39;m not really going to do that so  next thing i&amp;#39;m going to do and i&amp;#39;m not  going to go to my sink and exactly show  you  but i&amp;#39;m going to take while it&amp;#39;s still  kind of warm i&amp;#39;m going to run some cool  water over the bottom on the outside so  i can stand to handle it  and then um  while the inside of it&amp;#39;s still warm it  makes it really easy to get these tabs  off so i can kind of get them off of my  fingernail or i can take like a butter  knife or something and pull out those  tabs and i&amp;#39;m going to wipe out the  inside real good so i can reuse this  container for candles or i can reuse it  for storage purposes  in this case i&amp;#39;m going to use it to um  after i clean it out to re-melt this wax  so that i can put it in another  container so  um i hope that kind of helped you guys  and that you find ways to  reuse your candles or use your  containers  um  i try to make the best of all of mine  and you know then i get to  re-enjoy scents that i&amp;#39;ve already loved  and i mean like look at all that wax in  there that&amp;#39;s like quite a bit of wax and  it&amp;#39;s already burned out  so  i like to be able to re-enjoy the scents  that um  that i&amp;#39;ve really loved so  uh thanks for watching and have a great  night</text><text start="3.52" dur="5.92"></text><text start="6.72"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.91" dur="4.57">hello I&amp;#39;m Amy Wilcock and I&amp;#39;m the food  and lifestyle writer for the shooting  Gazette and today I&amp;#39;m going to be  showing you how to prepare game birds so  let&amp;#39;s take a look at what we have here  there&amp;#39;s a brace of pheasants a [ __ ] and  a hen and you&amp;#39;ll be given one of these  braces when you leave your shoot now  make sure don&amp;#39;t just go away with  anything make sure you get the right  bird and that means actually checking  their breasts because you want to have a  nice plump bird have a good look at your  bird so take them home take the string  off them and have a look see what  they&amp;#39;ve been shot because you want to be  a bit more ginger with the plucking in  those areas and the other thing you want  to do is you want to age your birds so a  really easy way of aging a bird is to  look at their beak and to look at in on  a [ __ ] bird the Spurs and the feet if  the Spurs aren&amp;#39;t very long you know  you&amp;#39;ve got a youngish bird and if the  feet are sort of tender not very  calloused again you know you&amp;#39;ve got a  young bird okay  so here we are we&amp;#39;re going to start  plucking them we&amp;#39;re all ready you want  to try and do this in an area where  there isn&amp;#39;t a lot of wind outside is  good if you can find us a wind free  corner and you may want to put down some  newspaper and I just have a bit of wax  paper here as well so the first place  you want to start plucking a pheasant  indeed any game bird is the leg and you  want to start with short sharp tugs of  the feathers you really don&amp;#39;t want to  tear the skin  so once the legs are pretty well  complete just a few little stragglers on  the ends here which we can tidy up later  turn the bird over and do the back and  really try not to tear the skin we don&amp;#39;t  want to tear the skin some of the longer  ones are a bit tougher but again try and  go right down to the base and if you  need to hold the skin because tortoise  skin will make it easier for the  feathers to come out now we&amp;#39;re just  going to turn our bird over and do the  front really actually have got a lot  done again just keep on short sharp tugs  so here we have our pheasant pretty well  almost there  as you can see you want to leave a nice  amount of neck exposed because it just  makes the whole thing easier and we&amp;#39;re  going to take the wings off I suggest  you buy a really good pair of poultry  shears that works well take those off  that and you want to just take the wing  and you want to cut it off we can trim  up the feathers at that first joint  but to get all these tiny bits of quill  out we&amp;#39;re just going to hold it over  candle if you have a gas ring I don&amp;#39;t  have gas here but if you have gas just  hold it over a gas flame if you leave  the legs on at this stage it makes it  really easy to hold as well  it&amp;#39;s much better if you can get the  tendons out before you roast the bird it  just makes the eating really really  tough  so again just take your poultry shears  and cut but not all the way through so  you can just pull out the tendon  sometimes they come out evenly sometimes  you really do have to tug away  now that our bird is plucked and the  head is removed we&amp;#39;re now going to draw  the bird and drawing it simply means  cutting a small slit in the vent hooking  two fingers into the bird and drawing  out the entrails it&amp;#39;s as simple as that  so there&amp;#39;s the vent and you&amp;#39;ll find that  there are some little bones there so the  best thing to do is just cut snip  through them  can be a bit smelly just put your finger  in and loosen everything up and then put  your two fingers in try and hook them  round try and pull everything out in one  go  a drawn bird and there we have a  pheasant all ready for cooking</text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.719" dur="6.001">so you&amp;#39;re saying i can make my own  window cleaner  hey guys and welcome to the very first  monthly e-o diy that&amp;#39;s essential oil do  it yourself now i know that there are  lots of recipes that you can look up  online and it&amp;#39;ll give you instructions  on how to make different things but i  have found that a lot of people myself  included like to be shown how to do  something so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to  do today today we&amp;#39;re going to be making  a window and counter cleaner and a lemon  toilet bomb  which i&amp;#39;ve never made before so we&amp;#39;ll  see how that goes  alright so let&amp;#39;s start with this lemon  spray this is going to be such a  versatile and useful cleaner for you to  have around your home it&amp;#39;s super  inexpensive and the only ingredients  you&amp;#39;ll need are  a glass spray bottle  one half a cup of distilled water a half  a cup of white vinegar and eight drops  of lemon or another citrus oil of your  choice  now there are several different places  you can get your glass bottles from this  particular one i&amp;#39;m using today comes  from a site called aromatools.com  and their website will be in the details  listed below and i really like their  bottles because they&amp;#39;re heavy duty and i  can choose from  a wide array of sizes when i&amp;#39;m working  on a new recipe so let&amp;#39;s get started now  the first thing i&amp;#39;m going to do is add  my white vinegar  now  i&amp;#39;m going to use a funnel today and you  don&amp;#39;t have to use a funnel but i always  make a really big mess and i thought for  the sake of this video i will use a  funnel so that none of you can make fun  of me for the massive mess i would make  following  so add my half a cup of white vinegar  into the bottle  like so  then i&amp;#39;m going to take my half a cup of  distilled water  i don&amp;#39;t like these pictures  i&amp;#39;m still making a mess it doesn&amp;#39;t  matter if i&amp;#39;m in the funnel or not but  i&amp;#39;m just going to make a mess it doesn&amp;#39;t  really matter so you too can make a mess  at home but you&amp;#39;re gonna have a really  great cleaner and then you&amp;#39;re gonna add  your eight drops of essential oil  i can&amp;#39;t  talk and count at the same  time literally going to just screw on  the cat now  shake it up you have your counter  cleaner it really is just as simple as  that and that&amp;#39;s really all there is to  it just shake it every time before you  use it and i wish that you guys could  smell it because it smells so clean and  fresh and not  chemically if i if that&amp;#39;s even a word  but you might be saying now lindsay i  don&amp;#39;t have a glass bottle and even if i  order one i&amp;#39;m not going to get one for  like a while well  you&amp;#39;re in luck because there are ways  that you can use lemon oil to clean your  glass and counters without a glass  bottle let me show you just dropping  some drops of lemon oil onto your  counter and then taking a warm damp rag  and wiping down the surface is all that  you need  you can also do the same thing with your  windows tip the oil bottle onto your rag  and wipe those windows down  remember lemon oil has such amazing  cleansing properties in it that makes it  not only good for our counters  but good for our bodies  now on to the experiment the lemon  toilet bomb for this you&amp;#39;re going to  need  a large glass pitcher  one cup of baking soda one cup of  vinegar  and five to six drops of lemon oil  now from what i&amp;#39;ve read this might be a  really fun experiment to do if you have  kids or if you&amp;#39;re just a big kid at  heart like me so you&amp;#39;re going to want to  add the ingredients in this order the  vinegar first  do your 1 cup of vinegar  into your large bowl or pitcher  the lemon oil 5 to 6 drops  and finally the baking soda now this is  where i&amp;#39;m getting kind of nervous  because this i really have never done  this before so  welcome you&amp;#39;re going to live this out  with me  all right so are we ready  one cup of baking soda added to the  mixture  it&amp;#39;s all oh and stuff  all right let&amp;#39;s go to the bathroom  before it foams out  somehow showing you the inside of a  toilet felt a little weird so needless  to say all i did was dump all that foamy  magic goodness down into my toilet i&amp;#39;m  gonna let it sit for a little while and  then eventually i&amp;#39;ll flush it down it&amp;#39;ll  clean out that inner ring of my toilet  it&amp;#39;ll also clean out those pipes all  naturally and it smells  smells really really good remember there  are tons of recipes that you can use to  clean your kitchen your bathroom really  anywhere these were just a tip of the  iceberg when it comes to cleaning your  home on a budget and all naturally hey  guys thanks so much for mixing

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.199" dur="4.12">so it came in a good rain and I came  into the garage I believe it&amp;#39;s a good  time to do a little more maintenance I&amp;#39;m  thinking changing the blades maybe  taking the deck off and painting  underneath the deck preventing that  future rust yeah let&amp;#39;s get started on  that so I&amp;#39;ve not pulled this deck yet  but it looks pretty easy there&amp;#39;s one pin  in the front and there&amp;#39;s two pins in the  back and the belt  and in the front pin  so now we&amp;#39;ll take these old blades off  and they had about a 3/8 inch gap that&amp;#39;s  why they were leaving a mohawk I&amp;#39;ll tell  the blades off get the fresh wash clean  all this muck out put some paint on it  then we&amp;#39;ll set the new blades on ratchet  strap  so after hitting the deck with a  pressure washer I have found some rust  we go in for a closer look  those are big flakes of rust that are  chipping off will chip those off because  some sandpaper do a little more pressure  washing not put some primer and some  paint on let&amp;#39;s see if we can get a  couple more years out up before it gets  holes in it maybe next year I can win  the zero turn instead of the push mower  and there&amp;#39;s the mower in the background  waiting for its date to go back home  once the deck rust out that&amp;#39;s not gonna  make a very good mud more  after about 30 minutes of beaten on the  rust I&amp;#39;m given up on it  we&amp;#39;ve lost public by a pound of what  used to be metal I&amp;#39;ve now got me some  Oslo Rufus applause foam that prepares  the rusty surface for painting then  we&amp;#39;ve got some heavy-duty primer for  rusty surfaces and we&amp;#39;ve got some red  paint if we look at the topside the  topside load good my first started but  this paint pills kind of like someone I  don&amp;#39;t fete the pain if it&amp;#39;s a powder  coat know what it is so we&amp;#39;re gonna put  a little oslo on this side too and we&amp;#39;ll  do some prominent and we&amp;#39;ll put some red  on so I&amp;#39;m out working on the mower deck  and the sprinklers have come on I got to  hurry up the grass is gonna be too tall  and I&amp;#39;m on the Oslo step you&amp;#39;re supposed  to put it all near it in let it dry all  night  and then it turns to us and some kind of  black and nurse metal not rust chemical  change will be going on it won&amp;#39;t be  arrested anymore  so let us do all night the more will do  some painting it is the very next day  approximately 24 hours later checking  out the deck and what the Oslo did you  do flip it over and check the other side  hang on second so here is the bottom of  the deck  they said it dust off any drop powder  and start painting back on the lower  deck they promise let&amp;#39;s try I think I&amp;#39;ll  lay it down and put another coat on and  then we&amp;#39;ll put a little red paint on it  I&amp;#39;m gonna put the blades on it then  we&amp;#39;ll put it back on until okay so the  mower deck the primer is all dry I got  the red paint I&amp;#39;m gonna flip it over and  put some red on it then on the bottom  we&amp;#39;ll put some red till we run out if we  run out any coloring on the bottom hold  me long won&amp;#39;t be moment  and now the mower deck is looking fairly  red  okay the paint is now dry we&amp;#39;re gonna  put these blades on and these are an  aggressive looking blade the only thing  left to do now is to put this chute back  on and to put the deck back on and we  are done well done and even though my  deck was pretty rusty at least we caught  it before it got to be this bad that&amp;#39;s  what happens and this is a  before-and-after of the blades that was  the cutting edge like a butter knife  so we line up the spring-loaded pin it  goes in the hole and then the front pin  and then the front pan does in just like  that one more step in radom are done  it&amp;#39;s time to mow  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  this is the old garden spot it&amp;#39;s not a  garden anymore it&amp;#39;s just weed now I  think I&amp;#39;ll raise the blade ups if we can  go through it on the other side you&amp;#39;ll  see my motor motor  [Music]  I&amp;#39;m gonna take you for a round along  I&amp;#39;ll control this with one hand and the  camel with the other hand you can see  what it looks like going through the  jungle  so on the old garden we went on a level  four I have beside the garden that was a  level two think that&amp;#39;s good and I&amp;#39;ve  been mulling probably an hour let&amp;#39;s  check on the blades one the pain off of  them I think up next I&amp;#39;ll hit this area  I&amp;#39;m not gonna bother to video I&amp;#39;ll just  show you the before and after here&amp;#39;s the  four and this is the after get in one  time on level seven I&amp;#39;ll come back in a  week or so get it again  or deck off the zero turn paint and  replace some blades I&amp;#39;m just curious how  good it is of a hill climber usually it  climbs good until the bottoms out some  will go down to the ditch truck on my  better side without the deck on it</text><text start="2.97" dur="3.539"></text><text start="4.319" dur="3.6"></text><text start="6.509" dur="2.941"></text><text start="7.919"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="4.14">hey Mike we&amp;#39;ve already hear from Mike&amp;#39;s  backyard nursery today I want to talk to  you about how to get rid of yucca this  is a big issue that people have they  take out yucca and they claim that they  can&amp;#39;t ever get rid of it there&amp;#39;s gonna  we got a lot of traffic on this street  so it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little bit noisy so  I&amp;#39;m gonna do the best I can for you  but basically if you have yucca that  keep coming back and you can&amp;#39;t control  them then the short answer is I don&amp;#39;t  think you&amp;#39;re trying hard enough and let  me explain what I mean by that we I took  out some yucca right here in the front  of this house and I took them out of  probably about a year ago and then we  landscaped it this spring and they  started popping back up now early on in  the spring we were real good about  coming out here and plucking those  things out and keeping them under  control but I wanted to shoot this video  and of course I&amp;#39;ve been procrastinating  about doing the video so now the yucca  and they&amp;#39;ve got a little bit of a jump  start on me but basically the most  important thing to understand is that  plants need three things to survive they  need sunlight they need moisture and  they need at least a little bit of  nutrition we can&amp;#39;t control the amount of  nutrition that&amp;#39;s in the soil it&amp;#39;s there  we can&amp;#39;t control the moisture because it  rains and the plants get adequate water  especially a yucca they don&amp;#39;t need a lot  of water so the only thing that we can  control is sunlight now there are a lot  of different ways to do that now one of  the things that Pam and I have been  doing here  with these things and I&amp;#39;m going to get  as soon as they come off we get on as  low as we can to me that&amp;#39;s a success  because I got that much of the road of  course they go a lot deeper than that  see again I got a lot of the road I&amp;#39;ll  come a little bit closer yeah I see I  like that now that one is a fail and  that one not so good so basically you  can see that I got some of the rut now  that&amp;#39;s not going to completely solve my  problem but if I keep doing that then  eventually they&amp;#39;re just not gonna get  ahead of me and the other thing that you  can do once you a couple of those that I  broke off you can still see the base you  can spray whatever favorite herbicide  that you have that you like to use  whether it&amp;#39;s vinegar vinegar and water  an organic herbicide or whatever I&amp;#39;m not  gonna tell you what to use that&amp;#39;s up to  you if you don&amp;#39;t want to spray anything  at all then you can simply pull your  mouse back put down a nice thick layer  of cardboard now for yucca I would  probably put down three layers of  cardboard and then put the mulch over  top of it I honestly don&amp;#39;t think that  they&amp;#39;re gonna push through that if they  do put down more cardboard but they can  be controlled you can win this battle  the way that you lose the battle is to  let them get that tall like I have done  here in the last month or so if I stay  on top of that and keep pulling them out  to see as soon as I see them and then  treating what I break off with vinegar  or whatever I want to use I sincerely  believe that I&amp;#39;m gonna win this battle  there&amp;#39;s no in a world that these yucca  are gonna beat me and come up and ruin  this landscape it&amp;#39;s just not going to  have persistence is what wins this  paddle so that&amp;#39;s my take on how to get  rid of yucca</text><text start="1.5" dur="5.94"></text><text start="4.14" dur="4.74"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.12" dur="5.1">hello everyone welcome back to my  channel yes it&amp;#39;s me this is Timmy he&amp;#39;s  gonna be joining me as well because he&amp;#39;s  gonna be walking around - he&amp;#39;s just  gonna be here with me today&amp;#39;s video is  gonna be on my friend Lana you&amp;#39;re very  familiar with her if you guys are  subscribers of mine and if you&amp;#39;re not  please hit the subscribe button below so  you can be a subscriber and you can see  a lot more of my videos and this look is  actually a look that I&amp;#39;ve been wanting  to create for a very long time it&amp;#39;s a  very chocolaty cat eye so I really  wanted to create that very like hot  fudge chocolate inside the eye outside  the eye and like really winging it out I  am working on a Q&amp;amp;A video so it&amp;#39;s gonna  be coming very soon I asked you guys on  Instagram what questions you had for me  and I got really interesting ones so I  can&amp;#39;t wait to answer all of them and  yeah stay tuned for that video okay so  Alana&amp;#39;s skin is already prepped so I&amp;#39;m  gonna go into the foundation and this is  the NARS sheer glow foundation in the  shade Barcelona and I&amp;#39;m gonna be  applying that with my favorite Kat Von D  brush it is the 25 brush and it&amp;#39;s all  synthetic it&amp;#39;s a bit fluffy it&amp;#39;s a bit  flat it&amp;#39;s perfect  I really really enjoyed this brush I  talked about it so many times and you  guys know I like to apply my foundation  in very thin layers just to make sure  there is an even coverage all over the  skin because whatever I need to cover  can be covered with concealer which is  what consider is meant to do  so after I bent all the edges in I&amp;#39;m  gonna go in with concealer and this is  the Norwich soft matte concealer in the  shade ginger and I&amp;#39;m using it with my  Sigma p84 brush this is the best brush I  found for this concealer it is one of my  all-time favorite brushes it really  buffs in the concealer so nicely and I  like to kind of blend and tap into the  skin to make sure I really get into the  skin again I am working in very thin  layers as concealer is amazing it  doesn&amp;#39;t crease and it gives you that  really flawless natural look it is a  matte finish but it&amp;#39;s not flat for  bronzer I&amp;#39;m going in with the Guerlain  terracotta light bronzer in the shade 3  natural warm and it has sort of a peachy  tone to it so to me this is kind of like  a bronzer blush combo which is why I&amp;#39;m  gonna skip blush for this look because  it does have that beautiful warmth of  peach in it and I&amp;#39;m just gonna apply  that where she would naturally tan so  high points of the face and bringing it  in as a blush for highlight I&amp;#39;m going in  with the Becca shimmering skin Perfector  in the shade cold pop I found this to be  a bit too gold and yellow on Lana  so later on I go in with a different  highlighter but I&amp;#39;m using this as a base  again highlighting the high points of  the face Cupid&amp;#39;s bow tip on the nose and  the chin before I get into eyes I&amp;#39;m  gonna make sure her lips are ready for a  lipstick later so I&amp;#39;m gonna use the Mac  lip conditioner all over the lips and  I&amp;#39;m just gonna be adding a generous  layer just for it to sit there and work  its magic  okay the fun part for eyeliner I&amp;#39;m  actually gonna use the Kat Von D  everlasting lip liner in the shade  crucifix and I really wanted a vibrant  warm brown so I am using a lip liner Kat  Von D&amp;#39;s lip liners are vegan so they are  eye safe but please do test the red  shades because some people are a bit  sensitive to red pigments so always kind  of do a patch test before going in on  the eyes  so the shape that I&amp;#39;m going for it today  is a very classic cat eye so it has a  sharp wing and it has a short inner  corner as well and as you can see these  lip liners are so smooth so they&amp;#39;re  applying beautifully and I&amp;#39;m gonna be  blending them in with a brush in a bit  I&amp;#39;m just gonna take my time and map out  that shape until I&amp;#39;m happy with the  perfect cat eye for Alanna  so working in thin layers you can kind  of build up rather than take away and  I&amp;#39;m gonna be putting that liner on the  inner rim of the eye and smudging it on  the lower lash line  taking my Wayne cause 0-5 brush which is  a pencil brush I&amp;#39;m gonna start diffusing  the edges now I don&amp;#39;t want to really rub  on the center of the liner if that makes  sense I just want to go on the outer  edges so kind of diffuse it very lightly  and this is what&amp;#39;s gonna give that look  a beautiful contrast because you have a  very sharp shape but then you have a  blended diffused edge for eyeshadow I&amp;#39;m  going with the zoeva cocoa blend  Voyageur palette which is the mini  palette and I found the perfect shade  for this color and it is called freshly  toasted and I&amp;#39;m gonna be taking that  with my Ray Morris number 9 brush and  going over the liner and over that  diffuse edge to really warm it up and  it&amp;#39;s gonna give you that perfect  photoshopped blend and what I love about  this look is again you have that very  sharp cat eye but you have that  beautiful diffused edge for mascara I&amp;#39;m  trying the new Norris climax mascara and  we really like this actually line I  really like this it doesn&amp;#39;t clump and it  gives beautiful separation for our brows  I&amp;#39;m just gonna brush Lana&amp;#39;s brows up and  I&amp;#39;m using the Tom Ford brow sculpting in  the shade espresso and again lion does  need much to her brow so I&amp;#39;m just gonna  fill in the tiny gaps but still  retaining that natural bushy brow for  lips I&amp;#39;m taking the Charlotte Tilbury  lip cheat and hot gossip which is a very  warm nude and I&amp;#39;m gonna outline her lips  and not really fill them in and for  gloss I&amp;#39;m taking the Urban Decay - gloss  in the caller ID cat girl which is a  light shimmery pink nude and I&amp;#39;m gonna  put that all over the lips and on top of  the lip liner as well  and that gives that very sexy 90s pout  which were obsessed with for highlighter  I think this is the only highlighter  that I have that I&amp;#39;ve hit pan on it is  the Fanta Beauty kilowatt highlighter in  the color mean money and hustler baby  and I&amp;#39;m gonna take my Sigma E 54 brush  and I&amp;#39;m gonna pack that highlighter on  the lid just focusing it on the center  and really pack it on into the socket  and the crease so it gives you that nice  highlighted edge repeat the same steps  on the other side if you want you can  spray your brush with fix+  and that was kind of the missing link to  the look I really love this and going in  that inner corner really makes the whole  look pop as you can see  and taking a bit of that highlighter  again on top of the cheekbones and the  areas that are highlighted before  because the previous highlighter was a  bit too yellow so this is the final look  let me know what you guys think in the  comments below and I will see you guys  next time I really hope you guys enjoyed  this video there&amp;#39;s a lot more to see so  click left or right and continue  watching throughout

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="8.269" dur="4.45">welcome back to cloud 42 I&amp;#39;m James today  we are still working on the tool post  grinder this is gonna be part seven and  as usual there&amp;#39;s a link to the previous  videos down in the description today  we&amp;#39;re going to work on the motor pulley  it&amp;#39;s very similar to the spindle pulley  that we made last time but the  dimensions are a little bit different  let&amp;#39;s take a look this is the motor  pulley  you can see it&amp;#39;s very similar to the  spindle pulley it&amp;#39;s just a much larger  diameter and a much smaller hub the  motor shaft is only eight millimeters so  we need to bore that a lot smaller and  we&amp;#39;ll see we can get in there with the  high speed steel boring bar that I have  to make sure that&amp;#39;s concentric I think  we&amp;#39;re gonna do the same thing we&amp;#39;re  gonna try to run this all-in-one setup  there there&amp;#39;s one thing that I want to  change on this I think I&amp;#39;m gonna add  another hundred thousandths to the hub  and the reason for that is after seeing  how the spindle pulley fit on the  spindle and I was getting about four  thousandths of run-out all the way out  at the edge I just want to make sure  that we get the best alignment possible  because this pulley is much longer so  it&amp;#39;s gonna be more susceptible to  running out if there&amp;#39;s any issue with  squareness in the mount so I had an  extra hundred thousandths when when I  machine it here and leave the screws set  where it is which would put the screw  hole then back towards the center of the  bore and hopefully that&amp;#39;ll give us a  little better alignment again since it&amp;#39;s  all in one setup it should all be  concentric and we&amp;#39;ll see how that turns  out I&amp;#39;ve got a piece of aluminum one  inch thick piece of three and a quarter  inch round and let&amp;#39;s go over the lathe  chuck it up and make a pulley okay yeah  to mount the workpiece in the lathe I&amp;#39;m  not going to be able to do it with the  outside jaws I need the inside jaws so  first thing is to swap those out  you know it&amp;#39;s real easy when you&amp;#39;re  doing this to drop a jaw so what I  always do is set it up so one jaws on  the bottom and the other two are facing  up then I&amp;#39;ll hold on to the bottom jaw  and as I back it out I don&amp;#39;t drop one  then you take the spider off  let&amp;#39;s get the outside jobs see these are  numbered it&amp;#39;s one two three there&amp;#39;s the  first one captured there&amp;#39;s the end of  the scroll and here&amp;#39;s the third one  okay now because I&amp;#39;m gonna make this a  little bit thicker I need this spaced  out slightly I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t  want to run out of space here but  because I&amp;#39;m trying to use the last step  on the jaw the center is too close to  use the spider spider will not  physically fit between the jaws so  instead I&amp;#39;m going to use a couple of  parallels to space this off and I will  just stick them temporarily in here we  turn it this direction so the bottom  parallel will stay on its own and I can  put the top one in and hold it while I  tighten this down I don&amp;#39;t usually like  doing this because it&amp;#39;s just so easy to  lose your focus for a minute the phone  rings somebody walks in behind you  something happens and you leave one of  these sitting in there and then spin the  lathe up and they fly out you don&amp;#39;t want  that to happen if you&amp;#39;re wearing eye  protection and you&amp;#39;re standing clear  when you spin it up you won&amp;#39;t get hurt  but boy it is scary and everybody  regardless of what they tell you has  made a dumb mistake like that and I&amp;#39;m  only holding this by a little bit so I&amp;#39;m  gonna get it nice and tight let those  steel jaws dig into the aluminum you  know see what that looks like spinning  okay that front face is running out  quite a bit but that&amp;#39;s just because it&amp;#39;s  not parallel to the back face okay let&amp;#39;s  be a turning tool get that faced off  [Music]  [Music]  not quite cleaned up getting close  now we&amp;#39;re not totally cleaned up on the  outside but that material is going to go  away so we can go ahead and start  drilling here we&amp;#39;re going to 315  thousandths and this is about 270,000  strizhov the same length and size of the  spotting drill I usually use so I&amp;#39;m just  going to skip the spotting this time and  this time because of the way we have  this mounted and we&amp;#39;re holding and have  space behind it I will go all the way  through without any concern  [Music]  and there we are through  okay let&amp;#39;s grab boring bar and just  clean that up and then try to figure out  about where we are okay we are going to  pass  [Music]  see how far deep can I actually go with  this before I hit something  oh yeah I can go all the way through  [Music]  okay so we&amp;#39;re right about 1960 fourths  which means they&amp;#39;re right now we are  right about 292 and we are headed for  315 which means we need to take 11 off  of each side I&amp;#39;m gonna take eight I  think and then see if we can get the the  telescoping gauge in there  [Music]  you know we really can&amp;#39;t okay let&amp;#39;s take  a caliper dimension on that says we&amp;#39;re  about 305 okay and if we&amp;#39;re trying to  get to 315 it means we need to take  another 10 I am just going to take three  which will give us six  and unless see where that gets us  [Applause]  so close okay so that says we&amp;#39;re about  three 14 and a half  let me grab the motor here which is of  course has the 315 shaft on it and it&amp;#39;s  not one to start yet I am just gonna  make spring pass just to make sure we  don&amp;#39;t have any pressure still  [Applause]  and try the fit again  there we go  Wow okay I&amp;#39;d prefer it be a little  tighter but this is the piece of stock  we&amp;#39;ll just see how it runs we&amp;#39;re just  done okay so that&amp;#39;s the bore complete  we&amp;#39;re within a half a cow  again not having a bore gauge that will  fit that maybe let&amp;#39;s see what that says  maybe inside the spherical points of  these things  it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re about three 15.8 I can  live with that it&amp;#39;s actually closer than  I expected to get okay next step is  going to be to turn back the step in  this and on the drawings that step is so  it looks like it needs to be 400  15,000th deep now that&amp;#39;s of course  adding a hundred thousands to what was  on the plan and the center diameter of  that needs to be 709 let&amp;#39;s start though  by turning the outside diameter this as  far back as we can and outside diameter  needs to be 355 just going here to set  up a dial indicator so we don&amp;#39;t crash  our tool that&amp;#39;s about as close as I dare  go so we&amp;#39;ll set a zero there  and put a mark there as well  try to get just cleaned up  nope still not cleaning it up okay  there we go that looks better  [Music]  okay let&amp;#39;s see what that is I&amp;#39;m gonna  need four inch micrometer here looks  like we are at three to ten so we need  to take 77 off each side  so let&amp;#39;s take two passes of 30 and then  take whatever is left  make sure my zeroes  here is 30  take another 30 now  taking this trying to break these chips  off  yeah we don&amp;#39;t like that at all  you take five off and just clean it up  so I get a good dimension  yeah there we go  [Music]  okay  stringy stream  okay see where we are  looks like 9 less than 100 so 91 so 3 1  3 Oh 91 and we&amp;#39;re looking for 3 Oh 55  which means we need to take 18  thousandths off of each side and that  sounds about right so that&amp;#39;s good take  10 18 let&amp;#39;s just take the 18 and call it  good actually you know what I&amp;#39;m gonna  take 10 just so that ships will be finer  it&amp;#39;ll also give us a chance to do one  more measurement  [Music]  okay it looks like 3.0 69 looks about  right 7000 go off of each side  [Music]  okay see where we landed there we go  300 fifty five and seven tenths good  enough for me it finishes good enough  not great  good enough okay so so zero here  I just got the tool touching lightly now  we need to go in 415,000 so I&amp;#39;m just  look at the draw  yes 415 thousands one two three four  fifteen this is where we&amp;#39;re gonna want  to zero  [Music]  right about there so I&amp;#39;m just gonna  reezy row here this is the back of the  hub okay  so right there is where we&amp;#39;re trying to  go I&amp;#39;m going to pull about ten thousands  back from that and make a mark  okay now we had a lot of material to  remove here  I&amp;#39;m gonna try to stay about 10,000 shy  of the bottom  take fifty thousand  in fact I&amp;#39;m gonna take a little bit  bigger chip here see if maybe we can get  some of these to break okay so this is  the feed and taking up to six thousand  spur pass we&amp;#39;ll see what fifty thousand  step to cut does here  No  a little bit less  another 50  and another 50  okay well we&amp;#39;re getting down close to  the diameter here and let me grab a  caliper caliper dimensions should be  fine for this and let&amp;#39;s see where we are  it&amp;#39;s supposed to be 709 and it looks  like we are at 937 which means we need  to take 114 off of each side and I&amp;#39;m  just going to do that directly because  again the dimension on this is not  critical  here&amp;#39;s 30  [Music]  yes we&amp;#39;ll be 60  this will be 90  hundred hundred and ten  210 so we get to take 4 on the last pass  as long as we&amp;#39;re going to make one more  pass one might as well measure again see  where we are and we&amp;#39;re headed for 709  and it looks like we&amp;#39;re at 718  which means we need to take four and a  half off of each side  this time we&amp;#39;re going to go all the way  into the actual zero  and then we&amp;#39;re gonna back face  the part  [Music]  and that&amp;#39;s proving messy okay let&amp;#39;s  let&amp;#39;s take a facing cut not all the way  to zero leave just five thousands  now we&amp;#39;ll go all the way to zero  back  and there we are  [Music]  that is the step in the pulley oh that  is gorgeous look at that and it&amp;#39;s got  fingerprints on it&amp;#39;s not as gorgeous I&amp;#39;m  very happy with that  okay curious where we ended up looks  like 710 and then it&amp;#39;s close enough to  709 for me okay next step is gonna be  the grooves in the pulley now we&amp;#39;ve got  a tiny bit of chatter on the small  pulley so I think we need to slow this  one down because it&amp;#39;s quite a lot bigger  this is about three inches  I looked at wrought aluminum with high  speed steel should we go in five to  six-hundred and at three inches five to  six hundred feet per minute is going to  be around 7:20 mm p.m. that should be  fine so let me slow this down  there should be ideal speed for high  speed steel and if it shatters we&amp;#39;ll  take it down even further okay so first  thing I need to do is try to line this  up with the edge this is the form tool  okay that looks about right to me and  bumping my head on the camera so you all  get to go for a ride that&amp;#39;ll be perfect  now I&amp;#39;m just gonna set a zero with the  tool right at that edge now I could do a  little bit checking here because  ultimately the second groove has to be a  hundred and sixty-three in so let&amp;#39;s make  sure I can clear that when that comes  160 there&amp;#39;s 165  yeah and we&amp;#39;ll clear easily okay first  groove needs to be at 71 thousandths  there&amp;#39;s a zero and that&amp;#39;s seventy one  thousand so let me lock the carriage and  we know from the last pulley that that&amp;#39;s  going to be a direct in feed of 90,000  set our zero touch off  to touch off  get a little cutting oil here  just take it in 95  thirty  sixty  seventies  eighty-five  dwell straight  over 95  we might as well take the other one to  the same dimension unlock this and it  needs to go into 163 there&amp;#39;s a hundred  sixty one two there&amp;#39;s 163 this one needs  to go in the same 90 thousands  zero looks good  three 90,000  forty  16 and that&amp;#39;s cleared out  eighty  pull out  okay it looks about right let me  let&amp;#39;s grab the thread wires and test it  Oh 63s  here&amp;#39;s pair of o63 wires large measure  one of these since we know they&amp;#39;re the  same  okay  see what we&amp;#39;ve got looks like we are at  307 t8 let&amp;#39;s see what the print says  Prince knows we need to be a 308 e2 so  we&amp;#39;re within mm per side I&amp;#39;m gonna call  that good maybe it&amp;#39;s the higher speed or  it&amp;#39;s a different position of the  compound or the cross slide made it  stiffer and made it bite a little bit  deeper  maybe I scraped it a little longer not  sure just take another measurement there  and see what that says this is the other  groove  this is 307 7 so just about the same  within a sow so it is slightly  undersized by about 4,000 so the  diameter mm on the radius and the only  difference that that&amp;#39;s gonna make at  that kind of level is just gonna be an  unmeasurable difference in the belt  ratio so that is going to be perfect now  let me grab a file let&amp;#39;s clean this up  the best we can and then grab a  chamfering tool and touch the edges that  we can reach with it  yeah that&amp;#39;s pretty good  [Music]  okay little Scotch break  what feels good they wipe these screws  out with a paper towel wrapped around it  all just so I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of oil in  there let&amp;#39;s see how the belt fits oh  yeah that&amp;#39;s great I&amp;#39;m really happy with  that  very very nice ok so now we need to flip  this around and get hold of it and face  off the material on the other side so  we&amp;#39;re gonna be grabbing the inside hub  of this however these surfaces on the  outside are going to provide support so  the cutting pressure is going to be  against the ends of the jaws so let me  do a little tapping and try to make sure  we have that fully seated I&amp;#39;m gonna grab  this pretty tight even though I know  it&amp;#39;s gonna leave some marks okay so that  looks like  yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t look perfect  let me grab an indicator okay let&amp;#39;s see  so that&amp;#39;s pushing in the most which  means this jar here is the one that&amp;#39;s  relaxed too far I heard that settle  let&amp;#39;s see how close we are now let&amp;#39;s go  all the way around here and get all of  these nice and tight saw that one move  let&amp;#39;s see where we are now and a  thousand so right there is the one  that&amp;#39;s in the most you know what I don&amp;#39;t  think I&amp;#39;m gonna get this to run any  closer than that that is just gonna have  to be good enough  okay try a different tool this time  let&amp;#39;s try some high-speed steel the  carbines nice and maybe I&amp;#39;ll finish with  it but let&amp;#39;s see if the high-speed steel  is better for taking off a big chunk of  this  a little lubricant very little because  it&amp;#39;s gonna  [Music]  well you see how this is going let me  just finish this off-camera and they  come back when it&amp;#39;s done this is the  same setup that we had in the mill when  we made the the spindle pulley the only  difference here is this is a little bit  larger so we don&amp;#39;t need the the  parallels because this pulley can  actually sit on the bottom of the vise  and it&amp;#39;s still up against the stop  exactly the same way let&amp;#39;s start by  spotting the hole grab a little 89 here  [Music]  okay that&amp;#39;s spine drill let&amp;#39;s put in the  tap drill okay tap drill  and then finally the tap lots of  lubrication for the tap and we&amp;#39;ll change  gears and do this nice and slow  [Music]  type check a little bit here we go  [Music]  now let&amp;#39;s just put the spotting drill  back in there and clean up the edge of  the hole  [Music]  [Music]  okay and we just need to rotate this put  a screw in here so we can see it easily  I just need to rotate it 90 degrees and  do it again  that looks about right to me they&amp;#39;ve  already got the spotting drill in  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  okay that looks good okay I&amp;#39;ve got the  screws in this now a pair of 8:32 screws  and on the motor shaft and lock down and  it spins pretty straight as far as I can  tell let me get a dial indicator here  and let&amp;#39;s see how close we got  now this is a thousand syndicator so  every line here is a half a foul  see how close we got here that is  fantastic  I&amp;#39;m seeing I was just over a half a cent  could not be happier with that okay well  now we have a spindle locked together  with a pulley on it and we have a motor  or the drive pulley on it and we have a  belt to connect them we are just a few  parts short of having a tool post  grinder here that&amp;#39;s it for today please  give me a thumbs up if you like what  you&amp;#39;re seeing and comment below next  time we&amp;#39;re gonna start working on the  clamps and the parts to mount the motor  to the spindle be sure to subscribe so  you&amp;#39;ll be notified when that happens  thank you for watching</text><text start="11.429" dur="3.391"></text><text start="12.719" dur="4.171"></text><text start="14.82" dur="4.44"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="7.6" dur="5.119">i&amp;#39;m making a cardboard cannon from the  roll it was once inside a lunch wrap it  could have been aluminium foil you&amp;#39;ll  notice that the piece of cardboard  tubing that i&amp;#39;ve cut is about the same  length as my longest finger and there&amp;#39;s  a very special reason for that as you&amp;#39;ll  find later now i also need a cannonball  and i&amp;#39;m going to make the softest  cannonball in the world  it&amp;#39;s almost completed you can see that  i&amp;#39;ve used soft foam plastic and i&amp;#39;ve  trimmed it until it&amp;#39;s almost a sphere  i&amp;#39;ve made that such a size that it will  fall through the cardboard tube quite  easily without getting stuck that&amp;#39;s also  important as you&amp;#39;ll see later on two  other things that i&amp;#39;ll need one  a long thin rubber band about the same  length as the cardboard tube and also a  matchstick and you should find that a  dead matchstick just sits across the  edge of the cardboard tube without  falling through  now you need to do some cutting on your  cardboard tube before it becomes a  cannon here&amp;#39;s what you need to do  at one end the mouth of the cannon you  make a small nick few millimeters  straight down and then turn the whole  thing over and make another cut directly  opposite that first one then at right  angles to the first two  you make another cut  and then another cut opposite that one  now i&amp;#39;ve made four cuts at the mouth of  the cannon  and you can see that they are in these  positions one two three  and four they&amp;#39;re at right angles to one  another the rubber band will lock into  those little slots  now at the other end the base of the  cannon you make two cuts  and these cuts should be v-shaped  once again a few millimeters long  one there and then another one directly  opposite  in that position there  now to load the cannon you need to do  some pretty tricky manipulation with  that rubber band  the first thing you do is to place it  from one slot the top end of the cannon  to the other and then push it through  and press it down so that it locks into  position there then take it around  the mouth of the cannon and  put it down in that position there so  that it&amp;#39;s locked you take across to the  other side of the barrel of the cannon  but before you do that this is important  give it a twist so it&amp;#39;s twisted across  in the center  and then same thing on the other side  lock the rubber band down in that  position there and lock the rubber band  in that position there  now you need to push your fingers  through from the base of the cannon and  you&amp;#39;ll see now why it&amp;#39;s the same length  as your longest finger and somehow other  you need to hook the rubber bands  between two fingers see that and then  pull them through to the other end and  here&amp;#39;s the trickiest part of the lot you  take that dead match and you push it  through  between the rubber band and let it sit  in the little v-shaped slots in those  positions there now if you&amp;#39;ve done all  that carefully you should find  that the matchstick holds the rubber  band securely that&amp;#39;s the base of the  cannon looking at the cannon from the  other end you can see that the rubber  bands are stretched tightly ready to  fire out a projectile now the projectile  you&amp;#39;re going to use is a safe soft  foam plastic  ball and you&amp;#39;ll press that in gently  sitting it on the table don&amp;#39;t look  directly down into it there we are it&amp;#39;s  loaded ready to go how do we fire it i&amp;#39;m  glad you asked all you do of course is  to squeeze the cardboard tube you can  see what will happen to the matchstick  it&amp;#39;ll come away from that little v slot  and so the rubber bands will be able to  contract  coming upwards and hopefully pushing the  cannonball out let&amp;#39;s see if it really  works five four three two one zero  and it does try it on your friends</text><text start="10.08" dur="4.559"></text><text start="12.719" dur="4.241"></text><text start="14.639"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.11" dur="4.419">today we&amp;#39;re going to show you how to  install a drip line irrigation system on  a hillside this is the most efficient  way to water a landscaped hillside area  a drip line irrigation system eliminates  the typical problems associated with  sprinkler systems such as runoff  evaporation overspray and wind drift all  of which can harm your landscape the  first step is preparing for installation  let&amp;#39;s get started  before starting any kind of digging be  sure you know what&amp;#39;s underneath the  areas to be dug up in most areas calling  811 to the right folks who can come out  and mark the location of utility lines  on your property as shown in this clip  you can also call the local utility to  have them come out be sure to call cable  water sewer storm gas phone and electric  now that you know where to safely dig  you&amp;#39;re going to need a few tools for  this particular installation we need the  following 100 foot tape measure 2  adjustable pliers shovel rake pipe  cutter 300 feet of Dura flow check valve  tubing with 0.6 gallon per hour emitters  and 12 inch spacing necessary 17  millimeter fittings to complete  installation this will be a combination  of tees elbows and couplers the amount  of these will vary by installation we  recommend using the agrifim smart lock  fittings properly sized PVC for header  pipe follow manufacturer recommendations  PVC fittings for valve assembly and  lateral line connections to figure 8  flush connections standard rectangular  valve box for the drip valve and filter  assembly  in order to determine your flow rate and  spacing you need to take the following  steps firstly you need to call your  local location services hotline to have  utility lines marked you want to ensure  that you don&amp;#39;t disturb these lines  during installation next you&amp;#39;ll need to  take a soil sample from the installation  area in order to figure out your soil  type the type of soil will help  determine the emitter flow rate click  here for more information about  determining your soil type third you  have to measure the size of the turf  grass area to be watered this will help  you determine how much dripper line is  required for the job lastly you have to  examine the water supply this will help  you figure out two things your water  flow rate in gallons per minute and the  pressure available for the installation  for more information on how to determine  your flow rate and pressure click here  for this example the soil type was  determined to be clay loam the size of  the planting area was 600 square feet  and the flow and pressure of the water  source was 25 gallons per minute at 80  psi this information will be used to  determine emitter flow rate spacing and  the total feet of tubing necessary the  drip line emitter flow rate spacing and  lateral spacing is determined based on  your soil type this residence has clay  loam soil using this chart it was  determined to use point six gallon per  hour emitters spaced at 12 inches with a  lateral spacing of 18 inches to  determine the total feet of tubing  necessary will use this equation take  the area of your hillside and multiply  it by 12 inches then take that number  and divide it by the lateral spacing to  get the total feet of tubing for this  residence the area of the hillside is  600 square feet and the lateral spacing  in inches is 18 which equals 400 total  feet of tubing  next we need to calculate zone flow zone  flow is used in conjunction with your  water source capability to help size  your irrigation valve drip filter and  regulator total zone flow equals the  total feet of tubing times the flow per  100 feet divided by 100 to figure out  your flow per 100 feet reference this  chart for this example the flow is based  on point six gallons per hour and 12  inch spacing which equals 1.0 gallon per  minute the total zone flow for this  particular residence is 400 feet  multiplied by 1 gallon per minute  divided by 100 feet which is 4.0 gallons  per minute  based on this residences total zone flow  of 4 gallons per minute and the water  source capability of 25 gallons per  minute at 80 psi it was determined to  use a 1-inch valve and a griffin&amp;#39;s  pressure regulating Y filter for this  application a 1 inch electric solenoid  valve was selected you will need a 1  inch PVC male adapter on the inlet side  of the valve and a 1 inch PVC female  adapter on the outlet side of the valve  follow these steps to create the  assembly teflon tape all threaded  connections on the PVC fittings and  pressure regulating filter connect the  1-inch PVC male adapter to the inlet  side of the valve connect the inlet side  of the pressure regulating filter to the  outlet side of the valve connect the  female adapter to the outlet side of the  pressure regulating filter tighten all  fittings with the adjustable pliers to  ensure they are leak free locate an area  for the drip irrigation control valve as  close to the center of the landscape  area as possible  dig a hole large enough to allow  adequate room for the installation of a  standard valve box connect the valve  assembly to the main line of the  irrigation system for more details on  how to install a valve box click here  follow manufacturer recommendations to  properly size the PVC header 1-inch in  this case measure and cut your pipe to  lengths to create the proper lateral  spacing 18 inches in this case and  install service tees between the  sections of pipe the lateral drip lines  wrap teflon tape around the threads of  the adapters and install them into each  service tee connect the header to the  outlet side of the drip irrigation valve  and pressure regulating filter assembly  cut sections of 17 millimeter blank  tubing long enough to reach the desired  grade of the lateral lines and install  them to the barbed portion of the  fittings make sure the tubing goes  completely over the second barb and  rests at the stop point on the fitting  to ensure a leak free connection  backfill the header pipe trench to the  desired grade measure out equal lengths  of 17 millimeter drip line to cover the  entire length of the planting area 75  foot lengths in this case connect the  tee to each of the feeder lines from the  header so that the top of the tee is at  great for best results we recommend  using agrifim smartlock tee start at the  top of the hillside line up the tubing  so it covers the entire length of the  planting area and cut the tubing at the  proper location to connect both sides to  the tee connection staple the tubing  every three to five feet to maintain the  proper lateral spacing throughout the  planting area repeat this process for  the remaining lateral lines in the  planting area use the same drip line  tubing from the laterals to connect the  lateral lines on each end of the zone  pipe cut pieces of tubing to length 18  inches in this case to connect the  laterals ensure you maintain the  intended spacing between them use  agrifim smart lock fittings to connect  the laterals together at the end of the  planting bed  now that the lateral lines and header  pipes have been installed it&amp;#39;s time to  install flush points locate them at the  low point on both ends of the zone  connect an 8 to 12 inch piece of tubing  to a tee connection at the end of the  zone slide the figure 8 all the way onto  the tube kink the tubing six inches away  from the tee and slide the other side of  the figure 8 onto kink tubing until it  holds the kink firmly in place select  your desired ground cover mulch and  place a two to three inch layer  uniformly over the planting area so  there you have it an easy way to install  drip irrigation on a hillside that will  save you both time and money and will  give you the highest efficiency possible  for your landscape irrigation this  particular installation shows how  effective drip line can be in watering a  hillside it&amp;#39;s slow targeted application  of water virtually eliminates the  typical problem of runoff and can be  made to work in all soil types in  addition it applies water directly to  the plants roots resulting in the  healthiest best looking plants possible  for more

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.65" dur="19.28">with my pants down  [Music]  so a couple weeks back we went out to  the NHRA Top Fuel Finals at Pomona and  we&amp;#39;re hanging out with our girl Lea  Pritchett and as always we were pretty  stoked to hang out in the pits and see  what goes into keeping these insane cars  running so she invited us out to Don  Schumacher racing in Indiana to come  take a behind-the-scenes look at what  goes into making these things so friggin  crazy so you want to go to Indiana go  check out racecars  I heard it&amp;#39;s cold and miserable but they  got big ol blowers and huge v8 sign me  up  get off  [Music]  don&amp;#39;t let Zach sunglasses fool you it is  20 degrees outside because we&amp;#39;re in  Indiana here at Don Schumacher racing  thanks man  dude this is not rated for this weather  don&amp;#39;t have those all Awards no yeah  there&amp;#39;s all of them up there to nose  then another one of these guys so we  want to do today is kind of give you  guys a walk around what the hell makes  this thing so crazy because we&amp;#39;re all  really interested and we&amp;#39;ve been out to  the the test days with Lea Pritchett  and got to watch them work on the car  and tear these engines down  [Music]  it&amp;#39;s pretty nuts but like we couldn&amp;#39;t  really bother them too much since it  they&amp;#39;re like focused on racing so they  invited us out here give us a  walkthrough of what makes these things  work  let&amp;#39;s go finally a sub cow how are you  yeah who are you and what do you do name  is Kyle Cunningham I&amp;#39;m a marketing  manager for Don Schumacher racing all  right we get to drive the car exactly  think today well first what is what does  it cost us to fire this thing up for for  a couple minutes a path is anywhere from  10 to 14 grand on draw or seconds the  car runs for about two minutes  that&amp;#39;s if nothing goes wrong car runs  for two minutes that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s longer  than that&amp;#39;s about a minute fifty long  and it hurts car run do you think it&amp;#39;s  more reliable than a rotary  that&amp;#39;s just for you guys to [ __ ] talk  online just like so uh where&amp;#39;s Leah Leah  is on her way back from Vegas right now  so she&amp;#39;ll be here this afternoon just to  this was her idea right current and we  planned this months in advance so yeah  Leah frigid ultimate scumbag doesn&amp;#39;t  show up to her own event salad  if I was any taller I literally wouldn&amp;#39;t  be able to fit here I have less than an  inch clearance on my head  how&amp;#39;s that a seating position you know  I&amp;#39;m ready to rip this thing man Kyle  Kyle we do walk me through what these  are again yeah so on your left hand you  have the fuel pump controller basically  it&amp;#39;s all mechanical so you turn it on  turn off this way so when you&amp;#39;re doing  the the burnout you just open it up a  little bit and then when they&amp;#39;re staging  before they run they make it wide open  yeah the fuel line actually runs past  the driver it&amp;#39;s a two inch fuel line  right there yeah look at th fuel feed  yeah about 16 gallons in one run but  there&amp;#39;s actually a flat valve in the  front of the car because take a gallon  milk jug pop the top turn it upside down  there&amp;#39;s gonna be a suction factor right  pushed on the kilcher take the same  gallon note that topical on the bottom  yeah upside down statists us same thing  for us we got to get air to the fuel to  be able to get the fuel pump rise your  shotgunning the fuel tank especially you  run a set amount of fuel right here 16  gallon tank yeah so about 16 that thinks  what it holds so obviously they don&amp;#39;t  try to go through all of that right I&amp;#39;m  gonna lean out the engine so like you do  you have to really time staging the  burnout everything right like every  second is so crucial exactly so if  there&amp;#39;s two guys two people sitting at  the grocery you&amp;#39;re trying to burn their  brother down exactly then you&amp;#39;re just  the clutch is getting hot and burning  through dad  your night show and then so this is too  much of that burned down tactics at top  yes it&amp;#39;s seven seconds I think is the  time that like once somebody else stage  you have to be the American I think for  wide I mean it&amp;#39;s just drivers yeah  totally trying to get in there might not  fit in there was Europe the competitor  of the you know their energy to grow up  or waste wise because you have to have a  minimum weight so the amount of per  gallon what it weighs like a factor in  day all right you can actually crew  chiefs all those facts as I can so Kyle  invited us back into the shop to check  out the place that makes all this crazy  stuff work I think there&amp;#39;s some like  top-secret stuff or not supposed to show  so star that like blurt all of it  [Music]  small little lost shop 150,000 square  feet 125 employees for a second race  dance basically we can completely build  a whole team the building with chassis  we build chassis for other teams in the  series of our cars of ours  just because dawn was to make sure that  everybody has a plan - first off you  guys have a shop that could fit like we  have 21 - mines that go to every single  race so think about this our first race  two years in Pomona California right  we&amp;#39;re in Annapolis we blow 45 grand in  bezel one way to get to the race to win  the race is 50 grand all right so that&amp;#39;s  possible we can follow regs inside - you  pretty much function like yes yes a shop  though our trailers are our shot  on the road and our a shop back here and  pronounced parade so what&amp;#39;s the sense of  having another shop when you have a shot  well that way we don&amp;#39;t have to unload  everything you&amp;#39;re storing all that  you can actually go through  [Music]  I&amp;#39;ve never been to our shop  so the engines 500 cubic inch aluminum  block any look at this machine work yeah  that&amp;#39;s crazy I mean that&amp;#39;s fully sleep  so you can put new sleeves and every  every single probably need to he&amp;#39;s got  he&amp;#39;s got a cabinet full of cylinder  heads Dan you got just spare one of  those things man so sheer heart does  bottom and on an trans car so you do  bottom end assembly bolt at the track  and in the shop so let me ask you a  question how long does it take you to  put one of these things together break  it down and put it back together for the  next run Oh in the car yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t  have it run in what 35 40 minutes what  is that  35 40 minutes to do what take the blower  off take the cylinder heads off push all  the Pistons and rods out inspect the  crankshaft replace leaves if necessary  you replace the sleeves it&amp;#39;s necessary  with the block in the car blocks hot so  they just pop them out let&amp;#39;s light em or  put a new one in camshaft and crankshaft  stays in okay if we just if we see  damage to either one of those then we  pull motor okay when the lifters come  out they look at the lifters be sure the  wheels spin if we see a problem on  either one of those there&amp;#39;s a little  roller not flat that bit roll okay what  are you looking for other crack just  visually looking at scores or cracks or  else you don&amp;#39;t measure anything nope I&amp;#39;m  just looking for cracks inside the  radius  [Music]  what the hell is going on over here just  just spotting spotting all a little bit  of eh so each team carries eight engines  with them at any given point so this is  the army pit where they&amp;#39;re going through  their engines it looks like this has  gone through yeah a pair so we we do our  own repairs here basically what happens  is you know no connectors while we call  it blowing out a window what that means  is it&amp;#39;s really about the side of the  block so we have donor blocks where you  can cut that part out and then weld it  back in oh really and breathe but  they&amp;#39;re not just junk yeah so crankshaft  is like five grand or so and we used to  be able to get anywhere from like 10 14  runs out of them but that was when we  made 8,000 horsepower and now we&amp;#39;re in  just make eleven thousand horsepower so  the crank shafts only last anywhere from  one say six runs so you&amp;#39;re going through  way more crankshaft something used to I  think we play go through like half a  million dollars for the cranks got a  little more so this is a 20 car body as  comes to our house  so it doesn&amp;#39;t have any of the inner guts  firewall titanium anything like that  weights about a hundred and twenty  pounds I think this whole body is 120  pounds if it wasn&amp;#39;t such an awkward side  and then what they&amp;#39;re fully done ready  to race now 280 300 pounds all right  what&amp;#39;s the difference of wheelbase  20 car and a top school top fuel is 300  inches so think about this on top of  your car  by the time the rear tires kid for the  front tires are it&amp;#39;s already doing 100  miles of 300 inches what was that five  miles an hour and 300 inches have no  idea is this another supercharger  it&amp;#39;s just prototype prototype  supercharger here AC and heat for the  building cool in the offices all right  fire this thing yeah hey when you got  will woods on your machine screw stick  so my name is Neil Strauss ba and I&amp;#39;m a  crew chief on the Anthony here Oh funny  what is all this  so this is our menagerie of parts that  we&amp;#39;ve turned into a blower dyno so we&amp;#39;ve  got this this motor over here turn this  drive shaft through the braking system  we&amp;#39;re a series of pulleys it takes this  1500 pound flywheel close to 8,000 rpm  if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken  through the shaft here that will get  this thing up to speed this is what we  call the idle motor which will turn the  blower rpm and what we idle the car ask  them around 2500 rpm  whatever it&amp;#39;s go time then we slammed  ministry desk clutch into place and  spools the bore from 2500 rpm to 12,000  without that engine running without the  engine running there&amp;#39;s actually no  Pistons  there&amp;#39;s no rods it&amp;#39;s just got to  straight through a shaft that spins the  blower and we have all the pressure  sensors in the cylinder there we measure  the amount of area that it sucks in and  then the amount of pressure that it puts  out  oh that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s exhaust on it yeah  okay and then it goes basically through  the exhaust the whole time we&amp;#39;re pumping  that water soluble oil through this  which is to simulate fuel right to keep  the rotor school so one thing is I mean  these cars obviously they do 300 miles  an hour so on the dyno you don&amp;#39;t have to  do anything to stimulate air flow we&amp;#39;d  love to just correct like honestly I  think like this shit&amp;#39;s really cool  because like we all know about engines  and superchargers or whatever but this  is like a whole other level like that  people don&amp;#39;t ever mess with they really  get the privilege to see this one the  whole contraption is just we&amp;#39;re didn&amp;#39;t  do this okay I can&amp;#39;t imagine many other  people have good setup  well there&amp;#39;s pie I think there&amp;#39;s about  four of them in the world it just has  this unbelievable scream about it that  you can hear you know clear in the front  office so when this thing goes off  everybody in the building knows ok can  we fire it up can we fire it up  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  so at the end of the world  [Music]  yeah is not here but it&amp;#39;s alright  because Kanan come in with my pants down  man he&amp;#39;s gonna put on all her gear how  many layers does she wear base cut base  layers so there&amp;#39;s this one and then once  you put some fire students  oh that&amp;#39;s it well it&amp;#39;s not really the  order that goes that&amp;#39;s okay would uh  would you would you mind telling him to  put it on like we&amp;#39;ll have him put it on  an order and then you can just explain  sure yes yeah oh nice I could it&amp;#39;s a  gaff taped up I don&amp;#39;t the block is hot  at Don Schumacher when you feel like you  know you&amp;#39;re not gonna have a real dirty  Bay is when you pull this bad boy out  for Vegas okay you guys stuntin when you  go to Vegas now when you say like a  really dirty day like do you normally  like I don&amp;#39;t know like just get filthy  in the race car or like right okay on  the bag it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not that better  but no that&amp;#39;s good okay if you were a  funny car if you were in a funny car  this thing would just be destroyed like  just might taste an oil cake and  everything and clutch dust absolutely  potential fires I don&amp;#39;t have my fire  burnt ones uh then we go to other races  where we&amp;#39;re still primaries hold on Owen  nonchalantly said I don&amp;#39;t have my fire  burnt ones I don&amp;#39;t these are doing the  prime conditions I haven&amp;#39;t I haven&amp;#39;t  been on fire and they&amp;#39;re like three  years so we&amp;#39;re on good streak not done  welcome another race car the race car  has been on fire a couple of times  but it&amp;#39;s uh it doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t come  in inside the cockpit wow that&amp;#39;s good  safety safety first when you run and  ready in Pennsylvania you run this one  and this year who the black demon the  demon you can won a suit at SF 520 suit  for a thing up to five years the same  one when you put this on you have then  40 seconds before your body would endure  a second-degree burn so that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the  highest rating it&amp;#39;s the highest one  before you would get a second-degree  burn  so which one Leah oh let&amp;#39;s see  white why why Pennzoil okay now what is  one of these cost free branding  typically and I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not sales rep  for impact but somewhere along the lines  is $2,500 or so play five to three and  then you stack on all this branding each  suit here because there you go and then  now now you&amp;#39;re feeling now you feel in  the rider Oh Jimmy or an eg real quick  sometimes thing sometimes there&amp;#39;s a  process it may or may not be  superstitious sorry all right now you&amp;#39;re  good so suck sound and take a seat  alright and you&amp;#39;re like man I really  feel like my my my brand new underwear  is riding up but it&amp;#39;s not [ __ ] you  Jimmy here yeah this word would come and  do the thing thank you pull that up you  might feel a little awkward here for a  minute but you&amp;#39;re gonna be fine just  right oh yeah you take me to dinner  Yeah right it&amp;#39;s like a dream  oh you want the protection just come  over the Sox ditch yes let&amp;#39;s go yeah  yeah you got stage one completely a  stage two of you make sure you loves  yeah you&amp;#39;re under gauze got your neck  that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fire is what that is  it was late at one moment in time it was  okay what track you&amp;#39;re at you have a  visor situation look at this there&amp;#39;s  like blinders it&amp;#39;s where you can only  see in like a straight line I like the  focus right you suck your visor down Lea  oh you really gonna want to see is that  racetrack that groove right from you so  in that event  yurina say Sonoma or Pomona that son is  just super narf you have an external  visor I need to be able to really focus  so I&amp;#39;ll change this out in the stage and  lens if I feel such if you feel such  necessary that goes on okay good we do  our burnout risers up you roll up the  stage and

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="13.17">[Music]  so today is the day last time I said  that I was completely done with the  Miata and we should throw it out or give  it away we asked you guys what you  wanted to do and then we talked about it  you might have seen when cyber you&amp;#39;re  making a death so as much as I wanted to  toss this thing away  it started to have some promise after we  fix some of the issues so we think that  taking a bunch of weight out of it  making a death cart might finally make  it fun in the yard if not this is its  final chance so what is entailed in  making this thing a death cart a lot of  sawzall blades and some pills what do  you think they&amp;#39;re not huh look how far  all the way down we got a two-bedroom  now so we just build it all the way back  up hold this out leave the strut towers  cut the whole front off and then we&amp;#39;ll  just tie in when you tube it and tie the  radiator I think we should be right  underneath the radiator we&amp;#39;re gonna tilt  back more so we  yeah what about we mid mountain or you  put it in the center  and then you&amp;#39;re just sidesaddle it and  let&amp;#39;s take the wheel wells out to  believe the - well we&amp;#39;re the strut  towers on this car I don&amp;#39;t want to make  short hours sweet that&amp;#39;s easy yes you  could go all the way down I guess we  could just cut it like this right yeah  okay the first time you&amp;#39;ve ever cut a  car into a million pieces that&amp;#39;s a real  question I asked him if he&amp;#39;s ever cut a  carp Argosy said stop what does that  mean man this is gonna be the last time  you ever get to do this come on you got  to do the back foot one that&amp;#39;s really  the way to are you practice yeah we  should definitely hang that somewhere  a nail gun so what&amp;#39;s the UH but we&amp;#39;re  gonna raise it up just a tiny bit yeah  yeah so we actually have those four by  100 tarmacs  ready put it on that the upper and lower  armor both bit do you wanna build custom  on so you wanna oh I need something to  start with we should have we should just  buy stock ones are really cheap well  well damn damn cowards and back at it  again with the Air Force One  [Music]  that&amp;#39;s funny as I was driving to work  and my music came on and Air Force one  came on that was meant to be public down  can

[Applause]  choppy choppy sugary looks better right  we&amp;#39;re gonna pull the doors right now and  I will start cutting the back and we&amp;#39;ll  pull the dash and stuff out we have to  help them build something hold the  steering column up this would be cool  with short notes Miata nose no nose  Miata I crashed the rear of a car that  was already crashed so I already had  less sympathy this is gonna be a whole  new vehicle  so I&amp;#39;ll treat it it&amp;#39;s gonna have a key  to best parts like this there&amp;#39;s a what  but there&amp;#39;s two different types of  driving there&amp;#39;s driving a piece of junk  but you give them no cracks about and  there&amp;#39;s driving something that you kind  of give a crap about but it&amp;#39;s still a  car so you should thrash it anyway  yeah  [Music]  so what are you what are you envisioning  two seats a steering wheel a gas pedal  and a clutch simple simple enough  nowhere where we&amp;#39;re going we don&amp;#39;t need  brakes  man I&amp;#39;m uh I&amp;#39;m curious to see what you  what you do with this thing because I  mean at this point well I guess so at  every point it&amp;#39;s been your domain all  this is coming off all this from from  the gas tank back is coming off so all  this will come off and then this will  this will come off because we&amp;#39;ll attach  the seat belts to the cage harnesses are  exactly and this will all come off so  like I said we&amp;#39;re just gonna leave  basically this piece probably some of  the seen already the dash will come out  so are we going like full over the top  who payload door bars you&amp;#39;re like is  that all gonna look like one crazy  chassis or we yeah yeah exactly I&amp;#39;ll  probably do like you said a main hoop a  halo and then a pillars and then we&amp;#39;ll  come back to the back like that&amp;#39;s gonna  be gone so it&amp;#39;ll be somewhere right  around the strut right gonna put a big a  swing on it - yeah  all this is gonna be gone it&amp;#39;s gonna be  snub nosed friend yeah it&amp;#39;s already see  it looks funny  it actually looks oddly tough like it&amp;#39;s  got a it&amp;#39;s got an interesting look to it  are we

Petersburg will be closed so too will  the British Council in Russian this is  an organization which promotes cultural  ties between Britain and Russia now  earlier we heard from Theresa May she  was speaking at the Tory Party Spring  Forum here in London here&amp;#39;s how she  reacted to the measures that Russia has  announced this morning Russia&amp;#39;s response  doesn&amp;#39;t change the facts of the matter  the attempted assassination of two  people on British soil for which there  is no alternative conclusion other than  that the Russian state was culpable it  is Russia that is in flagrant breach of  international law and the Chemical  Weapons Convention and Theresa May John  as we heard earlier also raised the  prospect of further measures being  introduced against Russia she said that  the UK would over the next few days be  considering its next steps after  consulting allies a hint there perhaps  that we may see some multilateral  measures being introduced against Moscow  we know that the u.s. the EU Germany  France and several Baltic states have  declared their support for the UK so  it&amp;#39;s possible we may see further  action over the coming days if we do  expect the Russians to retaliate indeed  russia&amp;#39;s Foreign Ministry released the  statement of its own this morning saying  just that but it reserves the right to  introduce further measures in case of  other unfriendly actions again in its  words John some are calling this a new  Cold War and adding to that a warning  from British authorities to Russian X  Isles what can you tell us about that  Dominic that&amp;#39;s right on Monday the day  that Theresa May blamed Russia for the  Solsbury nerve agent attack a prominent  Russian exile businessman and Kremlin  critic by the name of Nikolai grush  cough was found dead in his home here in  London and a post-mortem has since found  that he had died from compression to the  neck suggesting he may have been  strangled the British police have now  launched a murder investigation although  they say there&amp;#39;s nothing at this point  to link the killing with what happened  in Solsbury earlier this month the  authorities here have now begun to  contact other Russian X Isles living  here in the United Kingdom to discuss  their safety as a precautionary measure  Russia has said that they&amp;#39;re willing to  participate in this investigation  although today&amp;#39;s decision to expel these  diplomats is essentially the messages  this is what you get we heard from  russia&amp;#39;s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman  ray there&amp;#39;s a carava who&amp;#39;s often kind of  the blunt edge of the Kremlin response  she said that this move comin says  Moscow is angrily rejected of course  these charges at the British government  has levied against the Kremlin saying  it&amp;#39;s responsible for this poisoning of  mr. script Paul and his daughter  well it&amp;#39;s reacted with anger to demands  that they that Russia explain itself  saying this is a presumption of guilt  without any evidence they also say look  we haven&amp;#39;t actually been given access to  this NOAA truck this weapons-grade nerve  agent that the British say came from  Russia and which Russian says it doesn&amp;#39;t  possess so but if you actually go in  terms of public reaction what&amp;#39;s  happening here I think there&amp;#39;s an  assumption by many Russians that that  you know 23 diplomats for twenty three  diplomats you know that&amp;#39;s normal that&amp;#39;s  politics at play you&amp;#39;ve seen some  expressions of regret however over the  decision to close the consulate in st.  Petersburg and particularly the British  Council just been a source of much  cultural exchange between Russians and  the Brits so I think  but fundamentally after also keeping my  politics might play a role here  of course Latimer Putin is up for  re-election tomorrow many expect he will  win and this decision today Kremlin made  no secret of it it was Vladimir Putin&amp;#39;s  decision today</text><text start="1.709" dur="4.141"></text><text start="3.389" dur="4.381"></text><text start="5.85" dur="4.14"></text><text start="7.77" dur="4.26"></text><text start="9.99"

beef pork a chicken  or vegetable sausage entirely up to you  even if you want maybe go for like a  trade show or something a little bit  more spicy what I&amp;#39;m using today and as  you can see I&amp;#39;ve cooked my sausages  already because I&amp;#39;m just going to throw  them in to the stew a bit later  I needed a beautiful I&amp;#39;m got a pork and  leek sausage really lovely I really love  these ones so very lucky to have them so  just cook them a little bit stuck them  on the side let them cool down let&amp;#39;s get  over to the cooker ok so let&amp;#39;s get  started you&amp;#39;re going to need a kind of  big pan or saucepan I&amp;#39;m going to use a  wok today to say you guys can see what&amp;#39;s  going on it&amp;#39;s much easier to see so I&amp;#39;ve  got some oil in there which I&amp;#39;m getting  really nice and hot going to start off  by dropping in garlic which I&amp;#39;ve just  sliced roughly and chop it if you want  and then some onion  into that I&amp;#39;m going to add our celery  it&amp;#39;s a little bit like to say  everything&amp;#39;s optional here really you  can add any type of vegetable you want  and then I&amp;#39;ve got some bacon here or  some pancetta if you want it up just  roughly chopped out I&amp;#39;ve got a smoked  bacon we&amp;#39;re going to add a little bit of  black pepper a touch of salt  and then

that for about four to five minutes  on this kind of medium to high heat okay  it&amp;#39;s going on nicely I mean obviously  these vegetables are really still very  hard that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m going to add here to  touch of water now you could use a stock  if you wanted I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of stock  unless it&amp;#39;s freshly made and we&amp;#39;ve got  plenty of flavors in here already so I  don&amp;#39;t see it as any meat so a little bit  of liquid in there as you can see we&amp;#39;re  now going to turn the heat up on this  get this kind of braids in a little bit  just to give a head start for those  vegetables we&amp;#39;re still going to add our  mushrooms fresh tomatoes a tin of  tomatoes or can of tomatoes in the can  of beans and our sausages so five or six  ingredients still to go but we&amp;#39;ve got a  beautiful base here and this is really  really gonna be worth it  I&amp;#39;ll be back in about five or six  minutes and say okay this is coming

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="15.82" dur="7.84">hey this is dr. mohan with dr. morgan  and calm and as you get to know me you  will learn that there are few things in  life that I love more than a well brewed  cup of coffee yeah I would even call  myself a coffee snob mmm now with that  said this video is gonna talk about  coffee however not necessarily copy that  we consume you see over the last 10  years I have been doing extensive  research on coffee enemas coffee enemas  caught my attention through what&amp;#39;s  called the Gershon Cancer protocol this  is work that started back in the 1930s  to help the body fight off cancer now  I&amp;#39;ll go over with you in other videos  why copy items are so important what it  boils down to is something called  glutathione s transferase one dose of a  copy enema increases your body&amp;#39;s  glutathione by six to seven hundred  percent so let&amp;#39;s talk through how to do  a coffee enema now at first when i did  the research on these I was kind of like  really coffee goes where for how long I  don&amp;#39;t know however the more research I  did and the more people that I talked to  it became pretty evident to me that it  was something that I needed to try and  I&amp;#39;ll be frank to the first couple times  it was like I don&amp;#39;t know what I think in  this however after you do it for a while  it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s not uncomfortable it&amp;#39;s  actually fairly relaxing and it&amp;#39;s  something hopefully for you like for me  it&amp;#39;s a part of your life I currently do  about two to four animals per week to  maintain my current health status  you&amp;#39;ll need two to three specific things  the first thing that you&amp;#39;ll need is  specific coffee enema coffee rather this  is coffee that is specifically brewed to  be used in an enema I do not use the  same copy that I drink in my enemas I do  use a specific coffee brewed four enemas  second thing that you&amp;#39;ll need is an  enema kit so this is a stainless steel  reservoir and it comes with a couple  different tips that you use for  insertion and then finally we use just  some form of lubrication for insertion  of the tip I prefer coconut oil so how I  get myself ready for a coffee enema and  there&amp;#39;s many ways to brew the coffee the  way that I prefer brew the coffee is  just in my French press so I choose a  very coarse grind in my coffee blender  and then what I do is I brew a normal  cup of French press however I let the  cop the coffee steep for at least 10  minutes because I want all the oils and  tannins there as many as possible to be  pulled out you then need to wait for  that liquid to to cool to room  temperature please do not do an enema  with hot coffee you will literally burn  your colon so you always want to test  the water of your coffee before you do  any insertion the simple way I do it is  I just stick my finger in the water if  it doesn&amp;#39;t feel warm or cold to me that  means it&amp;#39;s room temperature now my  French press will make about a quart of  water now the amount of coffee that you  use when you do the enema is really up  to you  my recommendation is start with not very  much coffee you can work your way up to  3/4 to 1/2 of a quart per dose however  the amount in my opinion isn&amp;#39;t as  important as the coffee just being in  the presence of something called your  colorectal vein is so it&amp;#39;s actually  called your hepato erectus from your  liver into your colon  so once the coffee is brewed and it&amp;#39;s at  room temperature I will then dump the  coffee into the stainless steel  container I will then take a small  amount of this case of coconut oil and I  will  literally put that onto my rectum and  this is used for lubrication on the tube  there&amp;#39;s actually a locking apparatus so  once before you put the water and you  will want to lock the apparatus so that  once you pour the coffee and it will not  pour out you will then what I normally  do is I&amp;#39;ll place a couple towels on the  floor I&amp;#39;ll actually recommend what you  first start to do these to do them  inside of a bathtub it&amp;#39;s after you get  doing it for a while it&amp;#39;s not a messy  thing however some people just have a  little bit of peace of mind the first  couple times they do these so I  recommend you do it in a bathtub so  you&amp;#39;ll go ahead you&amp;#39;ll then insert the  tip of the enema into your anus and it  will be inserted all the way to the tip  what you&amp;#39;ll then do is you&amp;#39;ll lay on  your right side you&amp;#39;ll lay on your right  side because we want the fluid your  colon starts on your left side so we  wanted to come up your descending colon  and then drain through your transverse  colon and even down into your ascending  colon so that we can get as much of this  into your colon as possible after you  have completely emptied out the basin  with coffee you will then slowly remove  the tip from your bottom and you will  then wipe your bottom side and the goal  then is to keep the coffee in your colon  for between like five minutes to maybe  up to 30 minutes now your body will tell  you when it&amp;#39;s time to get rid of it you  wanna be able to hold it as long as  possible however there are no extra  bonus points for being a superhero when  it comes to this so when your body tells  you it&amp;#39;s time to void go ahead and do so  over the toilet as though you&amp;#39;re having  at normal bowel movements wipe yourself  up and something we&amp;#39;ll choose to do a  second enema after the first one because  the first one in a lot of cases will get  rid of a lot of the fecal material now  in my opinion it&amp;#39;s also best to do an  enema after a bowel movement because we  don&amp;#39;t want to battle any fecal material  that may be in your colon so give it a  shot again do it in the tub the first  couple of times and you will find is  that your body&amp;#39;s ability to detoxify  have this very powerful antioxidant  glutathione on hand this is one of the  cheapest ways in the world to do so so  any questions you might have send them  to us at dr. Mohan comm and best of luck  enjoying your coffee</text><text start="18.86" dur="6.69"></text><text start="23.66" dur="6.24"></text><text start="25.55" dur="7.23"></text><text start="29.9"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="4.86">hey Walter Sorrells back with more tips  for the knife maker today the easiest  possible way to heat treat a knife so  the single most important and  misunderstood aspect of knife making is  what&amp;#39;s known as heat treating it&amp;#39;s one  of the parts of knife making that&amp;#39;s most  daunting to guys you&amp;#39;re just getting  started out with knife making as a hobby  you know they turn on YouTube and they  see complicated furnaces and forges and  numerically controlled equipment and so  forth that professional Smith&amp;#39;s are  using to heat treat their knives and  they just think well you know I can&amp;#39;t do  that well actually you can what I&amp;#39;m  going to show you today is how you can  heat treat a knife blade using only a  charcoal fire okay so before we get  started a couple real quick notes you  know first point I want to make is this  is a real low to the ground method I  mean both figuratively and literally as  you&amp;#39;re going to see if you want the best  heat treating method on earth this is  not going to be it guys this is for  folks who have you know minimal  equipment just getting started or they  want to do something in a really  simplistic sort of way now second point  I&amp;#39;m not going to give a whole full  lesson here on the theory of heat  treating I&amp;#39;ll do that in another video  that I&amp;#39;ll be doing pretty soon but  haven&amp;#39;t gotten around to that yet so  anyway this is really just the five-cent  version of what heat treating is all  about the thing that makes steel such a  versatile material is that the hardness  and other qualities of the steel can be  tuned to optimize for particular  applications you can make steel harder  softer more brittle tougher springier  and so on and this can all be controlled  fairly precisely if you know what you&amp;#39;re  doing and the way to get there is by  heating and cooling steel in very  specific ways so what we&amp;#39;ll be doing  here is hardening the steel meaning  we&amp;#39;ll be taking steel in a fairly soft  form and converting it into something  harder and more  suitable for a cutting tool this process  has to be done for every steel knife so  it&amp;#39;s a critical skill and knife making  today we&amp;#39;ll accomplish this by heating  the steel up to about 1500 degrees  Fahrenheit and then cooling it very  rapidly by quenching it in common  cooking oil but the heating will be done  with charcoal here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll be using  first I have a knife blade that I&amp;#39;ve  ground to shape in my workshop  it&amp;#39;s made from 1084 high carbon steel  this is important listen up guys  the type of steel you use is critical  what we&amp;#39;re doing today you can&amp;#39;t do with  welding steel from Home Depot you can&amp;#39;t  do it with stainless steel you can&amp;#39;t  even do it with a simple medium carbon  steel like 1050 not exactly the way  we&amp;#39;re doing it to do it the way we&amp;#39;re  doing it today you&amp;#39;ll need what&amp;#39;s known  as an oil hardening steel will be using  1084 high carbon steel oh one is another  excellent oil hardening steel that can  be used exactly like we&amp;#39;re doing it here  you can buy 1084 in small quantities  from new jersey steel baron admiral  steel texas knife makers supply chance  supply midwest knife making supply and  plenty of others so I&amp;#39;m not showing you  how to make the blade I&amp;#39;ve got plenty of  other videos that go into that in a lot  of detail you can find links to some of  them by clicking the info button this is  just a simple test blade that won&amp;#39;t be  made into a fully finished knife I&amp;#39;ll  probably just hang it on the wall and  use it for shop tasks or throw it at  somebody I don&amp;#39;t like you&amp;#39;ll also be  using a hairdryer a piece of two-foot  long black iron plumbing pipe this  little magnet on a telescoping stick  blacksmithing tongs metal paint canfil  peanut oil and hardwood charcoal note  this is not your standard backyard  charcoal it&amp;#39;s actual chunks of wood this  type of charcoal used to be hard to find  but it&amp;#39;s now available in the US at most  grocery stores as well as at many  big-box stores and home improvement  centers it burns hotter and faster than  briquettes now you may be able to get  away  with using the backyard briquettes but  you&amp;#39;ll reach higher temperatures more  easily with the hardwood type alright  let&amp;#39;s get started  how&amp;#39;s this for fancy heat treating  equipment my son made this little fire  ring for himself and his buddies to sit  around in the backyard continuing on  with the fancy rig here I took my wife&amp;#39;s  hair dryer wrapped aluminum duct work  tape around the nozzle to attach it  firmly to a piece of one inch ID black  iron pipe don&amp;#39;t use galvanized pipe  it&amp;#39;ll produce zinc fumes and zinc fumes  are poison use the black stuff we want  plenty of charcoals so that the blade  can be fully immersed in the fire bear  in mind this kind of charcoal burns down  much quicker than briquettes so you&amp;#39;ll  need to err on the side of caution and  make a pretty good sized fire in this  case I ended up using the majority of an  8 pound bag by the time it was over  another point is this kind of charcoal  doesn&amp;#39;t operate quite the same way as  briquettes when you&amp;#39;re making hamburgers  you want the whole thing to turn to an  even gray embers but that&amp;#39;s not the way  you want it to work with hardwood  charcoal so we don&amp;#39;t like to fire quite  the way we would when we&amp;#39;re grilling  hamburgers we don&amp;#39;t need the entire  thing on fire basically what we want is  a nice hot spot and we&amp;#39;re going to crank  that up by blowing air into the fire  using the hairdryer oxygen as we all  know from high school chemistry is the  engine behind fire the more oxygen the  hotter the fire so we&amp;#39;re basically going  to just sort of drive that hot spot  through the charcoal adding fresh  charcoal as the fire burns down  want to do this without electricity just  go old-school using the helper and  common fireplace bellows oxygens oxygen  however you do it though you&amp;#39;re going to  have to have something blowing a lot of  air in there you can&amp;#39;t just let it burn  like you would when you&amp;#39;re making  hamburgers so once the fire is really  burning I&amp;#39;ll put the blade into the fire  easy does it  you&amp;#39;ll overheat the blade if you&amp;#39;re not  careful and that can have very negative  metallurgical consequences for your  blade believe it or not you can  nearly melt steel in a charcoal fire as  we&amp;#39;ve alluded there&amp;#39;s a hot spot where  the air enters the fire you&amp;#39;re going to  put your blade in there so the tip is  just hanging out the far side of that  hot spot the thinner the steel the  faster it heats so of course the tip is  going to overheat most easily in the  edge just behind that so try to build  your heat up from the tang and let it  flow forward now this is easier said  than done but just keep screwing around  with it that&amp;#39;s a technical term in blade  smithing by the way that means move  everything around you&amp;#39;ll need to fuss  with the fire you&amp;#39;ll need to kind of  move the charcoal heap it over the blade  maybe add a little more fresh charcoal  as you go just keep that hot spot there  and keep working your blade to let it  accumulate heat now because I&amp;#39;m filming  I&amp;#39;m doing this during daylight hours but  actually I recommend doing it at night  the color of the steel allows you to  determine very roughly how hot it is  watch as I&amp;#39;m forging here as the steel  cools of course it darkens up and that  gives me a sense of what the temperature  of the steel is now bear in mind using  color is not a perfect system you can  find charts and old blacksmithing books  that say such and such colors 1,400  degrees and such and such colors 1550  and so on they have nice names for it  dull red cherry red bright orange lemon  yellow blah blah blah but your  perception of the colors in the steel is  entirely dependent on what kind of  ambient light you&amp;#39;re dealing with  something that looks cherry red at night  appears almost black in full-on Georgia  summer sunshine what you can do though  even during the day is to see the  relative evenness of the heat the same  color across the blade equals the same  temperature across the blade you can see  in this forging footage how certain  parts are cooling down faster than  others same works in Reverse as you&amp;#39;re  heating it up when you see that certain  parts are darker than others you want to  sort of focus those in front of the heat  you&amp;#39;ll notice that I&amp;#39;m touching the  blade periodically with my little  telescoping magnet  when steel reaches a temperature of  about 1425 Fahrenheit or around 750  Celsius it begins to lose its magnetic  qualities so regardless of the color if  your magnet ceases to be attracted to  the steel you know you&amp;#39;ve hit 1425 now  we&amp;#39;re actually aiming a hair higher  about 75 degrees higher well we hit this  number perfectly now not using this  method but look we can get close enough  so once the blade goes non-magnetic I  know I just need to heat it a tiny bit  more as I said I&amp;#39;m aiming for about  1,500 Fahrenheit here so I&amp;#39;ll just run  it through the charcoal for 10 to 20  more seconds then in one quick motion I  jam it into the oil be careful because  it will flame up on you there&amp;#39;s no need  to freak out about this if it does just  be prepared for it I&amp;#39;ll add you Tate it  a little to get the heat dispersed as  quickly as possible  then I&amp;#39;ll immerse the entire thing  including the Tang in the oil  once it&amp;#39;s cool enough to touch I&amp;#39;ll  remove the blade and test to make sure  it&amp;#39;s hard I&amp;#39;ll do that by rubbing the  corner of a file against the steel if  the file bikes into the steel then the  blade didn&amp;#39;t harden on the other hand if  it skates over the surface like it does  here then everything is gone right and  now you have hardened steel at this  point your blade is very hard too hard  to actually use as a knife why too hard  because it&amp;#39;ll snap if any serious  pressures put on it so what you need to  do next is what&amp;#39;s called tempering the  steel meaning that you need to heat it a  second time to a much lower temperature  which will soften the steel and make it  less susceptible to snapping normally I  would just put the blade into a heat  treating oven or a temperature control  liquid bath that I can keep it very  controlled temperature if you want  though you can throw it in your oven for  an hour at 450 degrees and it&amp;#39;ll come  out fine but I&amp;#39;m going to show you the  old-school approach the way Smith&amp;#39;s did  it back in the day first I&amp;#39;m going to  quickly grind the black scale off this  blade so now I&amp;#39;ve got a nice clean  surface before I show you what I&amp;#39;m going  to do with this knife I&amp;#39;m going to stick  this little bar of steel in the fire  watch as right in front of your eyes  colors begin to form on the steel unlike  the colors up in the 1500 range which  are radiated from the steel these colors  are on the surface they&amp;#39;re caused by  oxides forming on the steel now if you  watch a move across the steel you&amp;#39;ll see  that they come in a range of colors and  this range of colors corresponds very  roughly to the temperature of the steel  silvery-grey is around oh 700 to 800  Fahrenheit blue and purple around 600  Brown around 500 and this yellowish  color which is traditionally referred to  as straw colored that&amp;#39;s around 400 or  just a little bit below so what the old  Smith&amp;#39;s used to do was heat the blade  just enough to bring some of that color  on to it now you want to make sure that  you keep the spine toward the fire  because it heats faster just as we  talked about before  the thin parts are going to heat  bastard the blade and the point so keep  those as far away from the fire as  possible try to heat that Tang first and  let the heat propagate up through the  blade to the skinny parts now I&amp;#39;ve let  the fire burn down and I&amp;#39;m using the  embers which are still extremely hot  don&amp;#39;t rush this ideally you want the  spine to start showing color first and  let that color move through the thinner  parts but depending on your fire the  blade itself may heat first if that  happens just cool the edge and tip very  quickly in a bucket of water in a  perfect world you&amp;#39;d like the spine to be  blue so it&amp;#39;s nice and soft and springy  and the blade to be straw colored but  you really can&amp;#39;t do that in a situation  like this you need a much more isolated  heat source like a torch to do that so  just keep moving it around watching that  color if you just jam the blade in there  and let it heat up naturally you&amp;#39;ll  overheat the edge and under heat the  spine so here&amp;#39;s where we landed it  worked out okay but not great it looks  browner in the pictures than it looks in  real life but the bottom line is it&amp;#39;s  still plenty hard for a knife whether  you&amp;#39;re a new knife maker without much  gear or you just want to do things using  historical methods now you&amp;#39;ve got an  approach that will allow you to harden  and temper a knife just the way they did  it 150 years ago or 500 years ago well  they didn&amp;#39;t have hair dryers but hey if  you&amp;#39;re doing this because you&amp;#39;re a civil  war re-enactor and you want to be  completely historically accurate you&amp;#39;re  going to run out and buy a set of  bellows me  hair dryers fine so if you followed  along but you&amp;#39;re making a slightly less  primitive blade than this you&amp;#39;re ready  to put the handle on if you&amp;#39;ve reached  that point and want to see what&amp;#39;s next  check out this video where I show how to  put a handle on a knife blade ok so I  know I&amp;#39;ve said it before but I&amp;#39;ll make  this point again this is not the most  optimal way of making a knife you know  is this how I do it my shop absolutely  not but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it won&amp;#39;t  work for you  and if you&amp;#39;re just getting started this  is a really cool and pretty effective  way of making  great little knife thanks for watching  hope you enjoyed this video if you liked  it here a couple of other videos that  you might be interested in also like me  on Facebook at Walter Sorel&amp;#39;s blades and  check out my website Walter Sorel&amp;#39;s  blades comm where you&amp;#39;ll find examples  of my work along with instructional  videos showing all aspects of Japanese  sword making including forging and  polishing how to make her moans and how  to make fittings scabbards and handles  for Japanese swords</text><text start="2.07" dur="17.1"></text><text start="4.89" dur="16.07"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="9.959" dur="4.451">okay I wanted to throw together a quick  video for you guys showing that I did  finally get it to move I got the  transmission working somewhat I still  have some issues I didn&amp;#39;t have when I  made these videos I didn&amp;#39;t have the  steering hooked up so I had to get off  and manually turn it around to to make  it go but mainly this this is just to  show that the transmission does work and  that the the way I have the COG setup  does move the vehicle which is basically  what I was trying to to find out see how  it worked what I&amp;#39;m going to end up doing  is I do have the brakes hooked up now so  that does help but I did end up with  some problems so I still got to do some  reworking with the transmission mainly  the problem I&amp;#39;m having is it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m  sure a lot of you are aware that the  belts started slipping and once they  started heating up and slipping I just  got worse and worse and finally when  wouldn&amp;#39;t move at all so if I had to do  it again I would change the size of  these pulleys I would make these pulleys  instead these four inch card pulleys I  would use probably eight inch pulleys  something bigger where I have more  surface area for the for the belts to  hold on to what I&amp;#39;m going to do now  though is I&amp;#39;m going to buy more of these  pulleys I&amp;#39;m going to double these up so  I&amp;#39;m gonna end up with two belts on each  side and that should give me the  attraction that I need now I also  watched a couple of videos from tank man  101 that guy&amp;#39;s brilliant he&amp;#39;s an  Australian and he makes tanks and one of  his transmissions he uses belts also and  what he does is he takes the belt and he  bolts on a seat belt  to keep it from stretching and so  basically I&amp;#39;m going to use his idea but  what I&amp;#39;m going to do is use a bicycle  chain and I&amp;#39;m going to wrap it around  the belt connect it and then bolt it  through to the belt I&amp;#39;m using some small  bolts and I&amp;#39;m going to I&amp;#39;m hoping that  what this does is keep it from  stretching I&amp;#39;ve I have to I&amp;#39;ll use the  seat belts but I have all this stuff on  hand so I&amp;#39;m  give it a try so I&amp;#39;m gonna bolt the  chain through and that should help keep  the belt from stretching and I think  that&amp;#39;s going to really help the problem  with the slipping so we&amp;#39;ll just have to  see but you know it&amp;#39;s trial and error  this is one of the things that you know  I found out and now I&amp;#39;m going to try to  fix it see what we can come up with but  I am slowly moving forward on the  project and just stay tuned thanks for  watching</text><text start="12.28" dur="4.409"></text><text start="14.41" dur="6.33"></text><text start="16.689" dur="6.18"></text><text start="20.74" dur="3.74"></text><text start="22.869"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.08" dur="3.68">andrew lessman of course he creates the  world&amp;#39;s finest vitamins  this is what we call a variety show so  we get to a lot of goodies  so i have to police myself in terms of  wanting to get  too carried away with one particular  product but when we say that&amp;#39;s the  andrew lessman difference  here&amp;#39;s another key illustration of that  anyone who&amp;#39;s had a bad experience with  calcium and let&amp;#39;s be honest  most of us have most of us at some point  men and women have been told to take  calcium  normally they&amp;#39;re rocks what you do  andrew is you  elevate that critical experience and now  you&amp;#39;re doing it at a great special  purchase price  hey by the way when andrew is here via  skype or otherwise we do great  not only great pricing and flex pay  interest repayments 30-day return policy  free shipping just choose your size of  choice in the 60  250 500 or that whopper  that 1 000 count and andrew like i said  here&amp;#39;s a good illustration  of what you do that sets you apart  within the industry as a whole  i i think if you look at two of our  products that most people  you know they get recommended to take  say your cardiologist might say take  omega-3s  or your your gp or for whatever it might  be for osteopenia osteoporosis just to  support a healthy skeleton  they make sure you&amp;#39;re getting your  calcium make sure you&amp;#39;re getting your  magnesium and vitamin d  hopefully vitamin k2 as well but those  two products omega-3s  and and calcium are the products that  most people have just learned to hate  that your doctor recommends you take it  but you try it and it&amp;#39;s just miserable  it&amp;#39;s either hard to swallow  because it&amp;#39;s a large tablet in the case  of of calcium or even the omega-3s  they&amp;#39;re large capsules they have a fishy  aftertaste but calcium unfortunately  calcium magnesium  we think of them as minerals but  technically they&amp;#39;re minerals but they&amp;#39;re  also  metals and as metals they&amp;#39;re not  terribly soluble  so unless you make a product that takes  into consideration  especially as we get older gastric ph  doesn&amp;#39;t go up we think it goes up it  does not  so as we get older we struggle to  dissolve and struggle to absorb minerals  and then when those minerals those  metals are delivered  in a rock hard tablet that&amp;#39;s the worst  conceivable way to do so  the best way to deliver them is as an  ultra fine powder  which makes them super soluble because a  powder  is soluble based upon basically it&amp;#39;s the  surface area exposed  and if you just had a rock hard tablet  versus the granules of that powder there  we&amp;#39;re talking billions and billions of  times more surface area  which makes it dramatically more soluble  and that&amp;#39;s a lot of  chemistry explanation but what it really  means  is that the capsule is small and it&amp;#39;s  soft because it&amp;#39;s an ultra fine powder  inside  it will be easy to swallow and when it  enters your stomach it&amp;#39;s not going to  sit there like a literally a rock  because that&amp;#39;s what it is when you have  minerals  in a compressed tablet they&amp;#39;re a rock  and it&amp;#39;s going to be a problem we don&amp;#39;t  like to swallow rocks  but this ultra fine powder will deliver  the benefits  of these precious minerals that we need  especially as we get older  and do it without problems and no matter  how precious they are  if if a product causes problems you&amp;#39;re  going to stop taking it you&amp;#39;re going to  hate taking it  so i try to make products that the first  thing i do  is eliminate all problems and if i can&amp;#39;t  make a problem  product that delivers the benefits  without delivering problems  i haven&amp;#39;t succeeded and this is the as i  call it the perfect calcium supplement  because it&amp;#39;s  small easy to swallow delivers what you  want does it affordably  less than a dime a capsule in the large  size even i think the two large sizes  are right around the diamond capsules  about less than eight cents absolutely  they are indeed and i know we don&amp;#39;t have  a lot of these available like i said  we&amp;#39;d  love to do some fun things in our  variety show leading up of course to our  first  official full look at our today&amp;#39;s  special boy if anything proves a point  that people love with the andrew lessman  difference  read those reviews this is a 4.7 star  customer pick rating  it&amp;#39;s also a customer faves weekend you  are one of our faves andrew of course  and whether it comes to the essential  one the cornerstone items  such as the calcium i just love that you  really respect not only the  ingredients your customer pricing of  course  in honor of his visit definitely grab  that calcium while it&amp;#39;s available and  it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s fun to have you here if  there&amp;#39;s ever been a time in history  where we really appreciate you  and the education that you provide it&amp;#39;s  it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a home run  all the way around my friend i try to do  my best  and as you know i&amp;#39;m not spending as much  time early on i was talking talking more  about covet 19 and things and all the  common sense things we need to do  um but this is for me calcium magnesium  these are things that they&amp;#39;re essential  all the time  and this is something that we need to  protect our skeletons no matter what&amp;#39;s  going on in the world  and this also has vitamin d as well so  as i said before it&amp;#39;s funny that when  you when i make products the reason why  i make products that have no problems  because i&amp;#39;m really sensitive to reading  bad reviews  and and i&amp;#39;m someone that i i strive to  make products that deliver perfect  reviews and i i read those reviews  so a product like this i would say the  reviews are 97 98  positive and oftentimes if you find a  negative review it might not even be  about the product it might be delivered  that the delivery got damaged or was  delivered late or something so  i pride myself not so much on on making  great products  but really paying attention to your  feedback so i can make products that  satisfy you  make making products that please you  absolutely and you do indeed  and when i was alluding to that  education process for a lot of us out  there i didn&amp;#39;t realize  i watched a lot of movies like i know  you and marielle do as well in the  movies they have good cop bad cop  well i didn&amp;#39;t realize that i needed a  good cop for my calcium  and this is something i really didn&amp;#39;t  even  know about until</text><text start="2.399" dur="3.36"></text><text start="3.76" dur="3.92"></text><text start="5.759" dur="4.481"></text><text start="7.68" dur="3.2"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.34" dur="4.81">hi I&amp;#39;m marina from riding warehouse and  this is gambler and today we&amp;#39;re going to  go over how to correctly size your horse  for a bit when measuring your horse for  a bit it is important to make sure you  get the right size so there&amp;#39;s a lot of  commercial products on the market that  allow you that are bit cisors you can  use those or if you don&amp;#39;t have that you  can go ahead and use baling twine a  stick a straw you can get really  creative in whatever you think is safe  to put in your horse&amp;#39;s mouth to measure  for a bit today I&amp;#39;m going to use a piece  of wood that is thin enough the Gamboa  is going to maybe think it&amp;#39;s a bit  already and have a really easy time just  fitting that in his mouth whatever a  measurement tool you&amp;#39;re using you&amp;#39;re  going to want to mark one side before  you stick it in your horse&amp;#39;s mouth to  indicate one side of the lip and then  that way you&amp;#39;ll just have to mark one  other side as you pull it out you want  to make sure if you are using a stick  that it&amp;#39;s nice and straight and then  it&amp;#39;s also free of anything that could  harm your horse&amp;#39;s mouth so this one is  nice and smooth so Gambler shouldn&amp;#39;t  have too much trouble putting it as and  smell we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and ask him to open  his mouth up sort of as if he was taking  the bit there you go and once he stops  kind of chewing around with it we&amp;#39;ll go  ahead and hold it where it should be  we&amp;#39;ll get the other side of his lip  measurement and then we&amp;#39;ll just kind of  slowly drop it out and let them kind of  easily slide it out you&amp;#39;ll mark the spot  that was on the other side of his mouth  and this measurement will be the  measurement that corresponds to the bit  size that you do get keep in mind that  if you&amp;#39;re in between sizes for a bit  it&amp;#39;s typically recommended that you do  go up to the next size is a bit that&amp;#39;s a  little bit too big is a little bit  better than one that&amp;#39;s too small if you  have a bit that you know fits your horse  and works well you can measure that to  get your horse&amp;#39;s current bit size you  want to go ahead and make sure that the  bit is laid out nice and flat and then  measure from the inside to the inside so  the inside of the ring to the inside of  the ring this bit measures at about five  inches if you have a bit that has more  of a fixed cheek piece - like a shank  bit or an egg but you want to do the  exact same thing with this bit it has an  ergonomic shape so it can&amp;#39;t be laid out  quite flat so we&amp;#39;re going  actually put it up on the bench and then  we&amp;#39;ll measure straight across you don&amp;#39;t  want to contour the tape measure to the  bit so inside-to-inside and this bit  measures just at about five inches as  well keep in mind you&amp;#39;re measuring the  inside of the bit because that is the  portion that will be in your horse&amp;#39;s  mouth keep in mind of the type of bit  you are measuring for if you&amp;#39;re using a  loose ring you typically need to go up  about a quarter size to ensure that  there&amp;#39;s no pinching if you&amp;#39;re using a  flat cheek or an egg butt or any kind of  shank you&amp;#39;re going to want to measure  pretty exact to what your horse measures  if you do have any questions or need  further guidance please don&amp;#39;t hesitate  to contact us you can visit our website  at riding warehouse.com</text><text start="7.379" dur="4.471"></text><text start="9.15" dur="5.37"></text><text start="11.85" dur="4.74"></text><text start="14.52" dur="4.62"></text><text start="16.59" dur="4.769"></text><text start="19.14" dur="4.44"></text><text start="21.359" dur="4.441"></text><text start="23.58" dur="4.14"></text><text start="25.8" dur="4.08"></text><text start="27.72" dur="3.899"></text><text start="29.88" dur="3.359"></text><text start="31.619" dur="4.471"></text><text start="33.239" dur="6.541"></text><text start="36.09" dur="4.83"></text><text start="39.78" dur="2.91"></text><text start="40.92" dur="3.69"></text><text start="42.69" dur="3.27"></text><text start="44.61" dur="3.24"></text><text start="45.96" dur="3.57"></text><text start="47.85" dur="3.48"></text><text start="49.53" dur="3.18"></text><text start="51.33" dur="3.6"></text><text start="52.71" dur="3.51"></text><text start="54.93" dur="2.76"></text><text start="56.22" dur="3.06"></text><text start="57.69" dur="3.33"></text><text start="59.28" dur="3.75"></text><text start="61.02" dur="3.389"></text><text start="63.03" dur="4.11"></text><text start="64.409" dur="4.801"></text><text start="67.14" dur="6.089"></text><text start="69.21" dur="5.82"></text><text start="73.229" dur="2.971"></text><text start="75.03" dur="3.839"></text><text start="76.2" dur="4.14"></text><text start="78.869" dur="3.42"></text><text start="80.34" dur="4.86"></text><text start="82.289" dur="4.591"></text><text start="85.2" dur="4.47"></text><text start="86.88" dur="4.5"></text><text start="89.67" dur="3.839"></text><text start="91.38" dur="4.019"></text><text start="93.509" dur="3.96"></text><text start="95.399" dur="4.051"></text><text start="97.469" dur="4.14"></text><text start="99.45" dur="4.349"></text><text start="101.609" dur="3.811"></text><text start="103.799" dur="3.901"></text><text start="105.42" dur="4.53"></text><text start="107.7" dur="4.29"></text><text start="109.95" dur="3.959"></text><text start="111.99" dur="5.369"></text><text start="113.909" dur="5.221"></text><text start="117.359" dur="4.35"></text><text start="119.13" dur="5.279"></text><text start="121.709" dur="4.8"></text><text start="124.409" dur="4.441"></text><text start="126.509" dur="5.521"></text><text start="128.85" dur="5.04"></text><text start="132.03" dur="3.41"></text><text start="133.89" dur="5.48"></text><text start="135.44" dur="5.52"></text><text start="139.37" dur="3.3"></text><text start="140.96" dur="4.5"></text><text start="142.67" dur="4.83"></text><text start="145.46" dur="4.05"></text><text start="147.5" dur="3.99"></text><text start="149.51" dur="3.81"></text><text start="151.49" dur="4.74"></text><text start="153.32" dur="4.83"></text><text start="156.23" dur="3.69"></text><text start="158.15" dur="3.39"></text><text start="159.92" dur="4.05"></text><text start="161.54" dur="5.01"></text><text start="163.97" dur="3.72"></text><text start="166.55" dur="3.39"></text><text start="167.69" dur="4.26"></text><text start="169.94" dur="3.78"></text><text start="171.95" dur="4.08"></text><text start="173.72" dur="5.48"></text><text start="176.03" dur="3.17"></text></transcript>

this portable bandsaw so if I  ever really need to replace the saw I  can use the table with the saw because I  feel like the clamping mechanism would  be almost Universal maybe just a little  adjustments here and there but it&amp;#39;s  something that I&amp;#39;ll be able to use for a  long time but anyway thanks for watching  don&amp;#39;t forget to hit that like button  also don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe it really  helps with wind in my cells when I&amp;#39;m  making these videos so we&amp;#39;ll see you  next time</text><text start="3" dur="4.44"></text><text start="4.89" dur="4.23"></text><text start="7.44" dur="3.869"></text><text start="9.12" dur="3.78"></text><text start="11.309" dur="3.421"></text><text start="12.9" dur="5.87"></text><text start="14.73" dur="4.04"></text><text start="151.49" dur="3.299"></text><text start="170.21" dur="3.199"></text><text start="181.27" dur="3.049"></text><text start="197.08" dur="27.149"></text><text start="226.54" dur="16.52"></text><text start="245.76" dur="12.08"></text><text start="262.7" dur="3.22"></text><text start="303.45" dur="5.35"></text><text start="308.31" dur="5.769"></text><text start="308.8" dur="5.279"></text><text start="362.27" dur="3.439"></text><text start="378.25" dur="3.319"></text><text start="393.76" dur="5.16"></text><text start="406.73" dur="4.189"></text><text start="415.59" dur="3.39"></text><text start="423.07" dur="3.31"></text><text start="467.55" dur="3.139"></text><text start="476.57" dur="3.1"></text><text start="493.13" dur="5.169"></text><text start="546.38" dur="3.129"></text><text start="556.13" dur="3.2"></text><text start="596.94" dur="7.89"></text><text start="637.45" dur="3.299"></text><text start="667.91" dur="3.09"></text><text start="703.22" dur="6.35"></text><text start="785.54" dur="3.09"></text><text start="837.64" dur="6.25"></text><text start="840.05" dur="6.63"></text><text start="843.89" dur="5.22"></text><text start="846.68" dur="4.32"></text><text start="849.11" dur="5.28"></text><text start="851" dur="5.64"></text><text start="854.39" dur="3.66"></text><text start="856.64" dur="3.33"></text><text start="858.05" dur="4.37"></text><text start="859.97" dur="4.95"></text><text start="862.42" dur="4.09"></text><text start="864.92" dur="5.16"></text><text start="866.51" dur="5.58"></text><text start="870.08" dur="3.78"></text><text start="872.09" dur="4.02"></text><text start="873.86" dur="4.17"></text><text start="876.11" dur="4.95"></text><text start="878.03" dur="4.83"></text><text start="881.06" dur="4.14"></text><text start="882.86" dur="3.93"></text><text start="885.2" dur="3.36"></text><text start="886.79" dur="5.64"></text><text start="888.56" dur="5.79"></text><text start="892.43" dur="3.72"></text><text start="894.35" dur="3.45"></text><text start="896.15" dur="4.08"></text><text start="897.8" dur="3.72"></text><text start="900.23" dur="2.88"></text><text start="901.52" dur="5.04"></text><text start="903.11" dur="5.1"></text><text start="906.56" dur="4.56"></text><text start="908.21" dur="4.92"></text><text start="911.12" dur="3.9"></text><text start="913.13" dur="4.35"></text><text start="915.02" dur="4.35"></text><text start="917.48" dur="3.84"></text><text start="919.37" dur="4.44"></text><text start="921.32" dur="4.23"></text><text start="923.81" dur="3.84"></text><text start="925.55" dur="3.39"></text><text start="927.65" dur="4.14"></text><text start="928.94" dur="4.17"></text><text start="931.79" dur="3.93"></text><text start="933.11" dur="4.41"></text><text start="935.72" dur="4.23"></text><text start="937.52" dur="4.73"></text><text start="939.95" dur="2.3"></text></transcript>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="6.649" dur="4.751">hello this is Christina coming to you  from sunny California and my kitchen  corner and today I would like to share  with you how I make my ground vehicles  it&amp;#39;s dinner for tonight and stay tuned  and I&amp;#39;ll show you how I made it so what  I&amp;#39;m going to use I&amp;#39;m going to use two  pounds of ground beef and this is ground  beef less than 22 percent fat and I&amp;#39;m  gonna use half the packet of this  Lawry&amp;#39;s taco seasoning and it can of  tomato sauce and some water  okay so I added about a cup of water so  that it will start cooking and I&amp;#39;m just  gonna try to even it out I&amp;#39;ll put the  lid on and come back to it and maybe 20  minutes okay so it&amp;#39;s been on medium heat  or medium to low heat for about 15  minutes give or take so I&amp;#39;m just gonna  do it now and I am gonna put half the  packet of the taco mix okay  and then one whole can of tomato pick up  tomato sauce then you&amp;#39;re gonna stir it  and you&amp;#39;re gonna let it do it though all  the liquid evaporates and then I&amp;#39;ll show  you how to drain the grease from the  meat okay so this is how it&amp;#39;s gonna look  and it&amp;#39;s almost done  and you should it still has a lot of  liquid in there so just keep letting it  evaporate and keep it on low and then  I&amp;#39;ll come back but I wish you could  smell this and as you can see if you put  the tomato sauce in it  the little smoke and then you only need  half of that packet of the taco  seasoning okay so when it gets to this  point what you&amp;#39;re gonna wanna do is give  it a big stir and by the way you&amp;#39;ll be  stirring maybe every five to ten minutes  just so they won&amp;#39;t get stuck but by the  time it gets to this point what it&amp;#39;s  almost cooked what I do is I just turn  it off and then I put all the meat to  one side like that and then I just put  it all up here then I live it they&amp;#39;re  tearing some paper towels and I just let  it soak up  and if you don&amp;#39;t use paper towels I  guess you can use a strainer in order to  strain the the grease but I don&amp;#39;t like  to wash the strainer with all this  grease so this is what I I would rather  do  Plus this way it&amp;#39;s easier to dispose  your hand I don&amp;#39;t want to throw it down  the drain so this is this is better for  me I&amp;#39;ll rather invest in some paper  towels then invest in a plumber okay and  once it&amp;#39;s all soaked up then you&amp;#39;re  ready to make your tacos  okay so this is how it looks after I  drained it and it&amp;#39;s warming up again  because I&amp;#39;m gonna start making the tacos  half of my family has already eaten and  I&amp;#39;m just gonna make my cockles right now  and this was the grease that was let go  this one in another one but just to let  you see and it&amp;#39;s easier to dispose of  the grease doing it this way so okay  there you go so I&amp;#39;m just gonna put it in  the bowl just to make it easier to  assemble okay these are some of the  tacos that I made half my family has  already eaten so I&amp;#39;m just gonna make my  tacos now so I just fill it up with the  me and then I like to put the cheese in  on the bottom and then I&amp;#39;m going to put  some onions I don&amp;#39;t care for tomato but  I&amp;#39;m just gonna put a little bit in there  and then the cilantro then I&amp;#39;m put it  down and just so if you have tacos yet  or but have broken up already that&amp;#39;s  fine I&amp;#39;m gonna show you how you can um  eat those actually I prefer them like  this you just put it on top and then you  see them through so you just kind of put  this stuff you want to eat and again I&amp;#39;m  just gonna put a little bit of tomato  and the cheese ice so I sliced up some  lettuce and I put it in water so that it  doesn&amp;#39;t turn brown but I want my tacos  with cabbage so this is how I&amp;#39;m gonna  serve my tacos in fact I&amp;#39;m just gonna  use all the cabbage because my kids  don&amp;#39;t like their tacos with cabbage and  then I&amp;#39;m gonna put the the sour cream  and then chili here are two options one  if the taco shell has broken and you can  eat your tacos this way or the  traditional way so hope you enjoyed this  video and let me know if you tried try  making your own tackles bye</text><text start="9.12" dur="4.649"></text><text start="11.4" dur="6.449"></text><text start="13.769" dur="6.271"></text><text start="17.849" dur="4.32"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.06" dur="5.009">hey there&amp;#39;s no calling here how to prep  leather to burnish now if you don&amp;#39;t know  what burnish is it&amp;#39;s the process of  taking a piece of leather that&amp;#39;s a  little bit rough on the edge and then  you go back and forth with the tool  something like this and it kind of  burnished it smoothes it out a little  bit our best bet is to take a piece of  sponge like this and you get it wet and  reach it over here to some water you  don&amp;#39;t want to soak it all you want to do  is get this moist and you go down along  that edge and get some moisture to it so  that it goes in now you can see maybe  you can see it that there&amp;#39;s a little bit  of discoloration that&amp;#39;s occurred on that  edge now I&amp;#39;ve done that and i&amp;#39;ve got  that wet matter of fact I&amp;#39;ll just go a  bit further here because this is a piece  of scrap wood you can see now how that  leather is turned out no you don&amp;#39;t want  to try and burnish the leather with one  of these or you could actually use an  antler that&amp;#39;s what I use a lot of times  you don&amp;#39;t want to burnish it until it&amp;#39;s  dried back a little bit because what  happened is the moisture is went inside  the leather and what I want is I want  the surface to be just if you want to  call it just a tiny bit tacky but not  really so you can see it&amp;#39;s starting to  dry already  there&amp;#39;s the moisture it was down a  little bit further and it&amp;#39;s starting to  go up further now I&amp;#39;m getting close to  that so I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and show you  so we don&amp;#39;t waste a lot of time put the  video  take the tool and I start going over now  I just did a little bit there and if you  can look you can probably see that it&amp;#39;s  smooth a little bit now I&amp;#39;m not doing  anything on the back I just doing it on  the front so I take this a night Bernie  [ __ ] back and forth and I move that&amp;#39;s  really fast I&amp;#39;m using this is just a  nylon tool which you can buy online or  you can buy a leather store probably and  I go back and forth on this and this is  what we call burnishing so the edge  comes out a whole lot smoother now a lot  of times if I&amp;#39;m dyeing the leather  I will dye the leather and burnisher  right after I put the dye on because the  thigh usually have  despite we got some oils in it but it  also usually has alcohol and they  usually thrive fairly fast or some form  of something that&amp;#39;s going to cause it to  accelerate and then I&amp;#39;ll do the same  thing and I don&amp;#39;t have to put some  moisture on in this case the leather was  plain and I put it in no I could use  this antler and it does the same thing  I had a friend give me this does he  collect something goes out there that&amp;#39;s  for the antlers and it comes along it  does exactly the same thing now as you  can see I&amp;#39;ve burnt East that smooth off  and you can see because of the moisture  it pushes this down just a little bit  it sounds like I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m right  close to the Snake River and you can  probably hear and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of  those high speed either fight boats or  whatever they&amp;#39;ve got two or three jets  that go out here you don&amp;#39;t hear that  bicker or you just hear a big pushes a  little things called by matter of fact  on my channel I got a one of my channels  I&amp;#39;ve got a picture one of them going by  and he was only going about  three-quarters of a mile 3/4 speed I  think it was checking it out for some  problems and it was still low but and  probably 85 90 miles an hour so anyway  this is about the burnishing hope this  has been helpful a little bit of  moisture you can see I don&amp;#39;t know if  it&amp;#39;ll reflect or not but there&amp;#39;s a  little bit of reflection that&amp;#39;s starting  off of that from my burnishing on it and  and that&amp;#39;s what you want when so  prepping it little bit of water you  could use right after you do the dine  either way hey I hope that&amp;#39;s been  helpful and you take care and have a  great day bye now</text><text start="2.55" dur="4.95"></text><text start="5.069" dur="4.801"></text><text start="7.5" dur="4.65"></text><text start="9.87"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="2.3" dur="8.08">hi it&amp;#39;s Monica today I&amp;#39;m going to show  you how easy it is to shape with  Guatemalan palm Lee Pat I&amp;#39;ll be using a  palm leaf hat that I got from somebody  hats and somebody is based here in  Houston I got an open crown hat by open  crown I mean an unshaped hat  it&amp;#39;ll be a four inch brim and I&amp;#39;ll show  you that all you have to do is just get  it wet I&amp;#39;ll shape it into a classic  cattle increase for you and I will also  shape the brim and after that if there  is any other crease that you&amp;#39;re  interested in learning just post a  comment and then I&amp;#39;ll show you how to  make the next crease thanks we&amp;#39;re over  the sink and I have my hat this is a  orange brown some body fat and you can  see the name  there&amp;#39;s the name bottom on we&amp;#39;re going  to close so you can see so and I&amp;#39;m in  the kitchen sink and I&amp;#39;m about to get it  wet run in the water  and I get the all hot wet  and as you can see I&amp;#39;m not submerging  the hat making sure the Hat is keep it  wet  so if I wanted to I could have filled  the sink with water and just dumped it  into the sink but I don&amp;#39;t have I don&amp;#39;t  have to do that so now we&amp;#39;re in the sink  what I&amp;#39;m going to do this is the front  of the hat here this is the back and I&amp;#39;m  going to press on both sides press it in  so you can see it&amp;#39;s forming shape and  I&amp;#39;m just tilting it a little bit so that  I can see how it&amp;#39;s coming out in the  front but squeeze it in on the sides  each side and you&amp;#39;re going to want to  make sure it&amp;#39;s even so you can see  that&amp;#39;s fairly even in front and then  we&amp;#39;re going to press the center in press  it down  don&amp;#39;t be afraid of it because if it&amp;#39;s  not wet enough you can always get it wet  again or if you make a mistake you can  correct it while it&amp;#39;s wet so there&amp;#39;s the  crown I&amp;#39;m just going to turn it towards  me so that I can see if it&amp;#39;s even okay  so that is the front and now for the  brim if you get the Hat and it arrives  kind of bent you can straighten out the  room if you want  but basically what you&amp;#39;re going to do is  curl the sides up  you want to use your hand kind of cup it  and curl it if you want to bring the  front down and use your thumbs  and I&amp;#39;m just scrolling up the sides and  I&amp;#39;m kind of over curling it because as  you can see when I release it it tends  to spring back so as it dries I want to  make sure that it stays where I&amp;#39;m  creasing it so I&amp;#39;m kind of over creasing  it so you can see that side then I&amp;#39;m  just going to turn it around so that I  can shape the other side and I&amp;#39;ve given  it a firm touch  as you can see it&amp;#39;s coming along and now  there&amp;#39;s a big space in between here and  here  so I&amp;#39;m going to turn it towards me just  that I can close that in some more so  I&amp;#39;m just kind of bringing it in a little  bit more in the front I&amp;#39;ll try and do it  from this angle so you can see a little  bit better  so I&amp;#39;ve closed it in and then the hat is  starting to dry on me but that&amp;#39;s pretty  much it  you can tilt the front down if you want  then turn it around so I can tilt the  back down a little bit but that&amp;#39;s pretty  much it it&amp;#39;s fairly easy to do but that  is the cattlemen crease  and I&amp;#39;m just going to turn it towards me  one more time because it looks a little  off-center by looking at it in the  camera give me just a second  but that&amp;#39;s pretty much it you just use  your hand you kind of cup cup the brim  and squeeze and I&amp;#39;m just hope my other  hand on the sweat band my fingers are on  the sweat band and just cupping it in  like that and I&amp;#39;m holding it from the  crown of the hat so that you can see but  I&amp;#39;m just holding the Hat from the  underside and cupping the brim of the  Hat with my hand so that is it there&amp;#39;s  the cowboy hat now if you&amp;#39;re wanting to  do something a little bit more  aggressive on the sides like a taco  crease then what you want to do is you  want to curl the back up more and by  that I&amp;#39;m kind of pressing down with my  thumb put the coral in return once you  can see kind of giving it more of a curl  because the taco crease tends to start  like right in here in this area so you  have to give it a really good curl and  then I&amp;#39;m giving it a good pinch  and this is going to require two hands  because the taco crease is pretty sharp  on the sides and you can see what I&amp;#39;m  doing and I&amp;#39;m pinching the corners then  I&amp;#39;ll do the same on this side I&amp;#39;m going  to give it a pinch now I&amp;#39;m doing is  pressing or putting a crease in here  real firm one  so that you can see what it looks like  tends to have more of a swoop to it  maybe backs you up see  so you can see that side this side still  needs to come in some more it&amp;#39;s trying  to come undone  then  okay and then I just brought the brim  down a little bit more in the back  because it tends to want to crawl a  little bit and that noise you hear in  the background is my two-year-old lion  but that is what it would look like and  let you see and some people like it to  come up higher on the sides but either  way that&amp;#39;s how you get it done okay so  here is the shaped at mix it from the  side in the back  can put this shape  and here&amp;#39;s where some people will add  the finishing touches and put it on your  head and if you see any flaws or let&amp;#39;s  say you want the brim to come down lower  then I&amp;#39;m just grabbing a hold of the hat  so it doesn&amp;#39;t move on my head and just  pull it down  and I&amp;#39;m trying to get the curl to start  from this far back and bring it down so  I&amp;#39;m using my thumb to kind of help me  create a curl  so as you can see it came down a little  bit more in front  so before it showed more of my forehead  and now it&amp;#39;s curl more but that&amp;#39;s pretty  much it this is a four inch brim  cattlemen crease watermelon palm hat</text><text start="7.049" dur="6.681"></text><text start="10.38" dur="6.899"></text><text start="13.73"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="2.56" dur="4.86">one go g&amp;#39;day guys now I&amp;#39;m going to show  you how to clean some nine bolt truck  they don&amp;#39;t make these currently anymore  they&amp;#39;re you getting the plastic track  for the power function battery drains  now the way I clean these tracks is I  get these rubbers now you can get them  at your local corner store news agency  or craft Center but I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not a big  fan of using sandpaper when it comes to  cleaning metal often because I find it  would scratch and wear it out now that&amp;#39;s  especially what happened to you in  Australia gets the humidity yeah anyway  make sure you clean the top obviously  everyone thinks oh yeah that&amp;#39;s fine  also when you clean the inside make sure  you do clean the inside because the  actual flange of the train itself is  where it actually picks up electricity  and then actual topper where it goes on  top of the rail is actually just the  rubber foregrip so please make sure you  clean the inside so you make sure the  tank is a good who&amp;#39;s even electricity  flow speaking of which also the outside  rail because that&amp;#39;s where your quarters  from the controller so your power cable  to the track because if it&amp;#39;s not clean  it&amp;#39;s always going to short-circuit  somewhere in the track so make sure the  outside is also clean and speaking of  short-circuits clean the connection  parts because if the connections not  clean between the two tracks you&amp;#39;re  going to definitely going to get a  short-circuit so make sure you clean  them now I clean the outside top and  inside and the connection points I&amp;#39;ve  like all my tracks especially with the  curve but seen with the crushed track in  the actual switching points himself with  the points especially I didn&amp;#39;t actually  bother cleaning the outside of the rail  because I don&amp;#39;t use the power cord the I  always use it on a straight or curved  track and the same with this cross track  I don&amp;#39;t even use a power cord on that so  I didn&amp;#39;t actually didn&amp;#39;t bother doing  the UM outside the rail main reason is  this is time consuming because I make  sure it&amp;#39;s a good job to make sure it&amp;#39;s  clean so the Train can run properly it&amp;#39;s  yeah it&amp;#39;s basic time consuming so that  did save me a couple of hours cleaning  because I have quite a few track so  whatever works for you but the main  thing you got to make sure you clean is  the inside top and the connection that&amp;#39;s  the main point and whichever track  you&amp;#39;re going to use  for the power cord make sure it&amp;#39;s clean  pretty much that&amp;#39;s it I&amp;#39;m also one thing  with the actual rubber itself if we find  it gets dirty this is the only time I  actually would use sandpaper let&amp;#39;s say  for example I will clean this track here  so not so not clean yet  now you can obviously and see now  there&amp;#39;s a difference between the clean  and not so clean same for this show  straight clean not clean now with the  rubber itself it&amp;#39;s going to get filthy  so when you get this won&amp;#39;t actually get  much darker than that so like black so  when it goes like that I don&amp;#39;t want to  be smearing it on to the track cause  it&amp;#39;s not going to properly clean so this  is when I get the sandpaper in and  actually properly clean it so once you  do that it&amp;#39;s back is almost brand new  and therefore it&amp;#39;s going to eventually  wear out like I make sure I get my good  use wear out of it but when it gets to  this size it&amp;#39;s going to be very handy  and actually cleaning the actual arm  points itself it can help because if you  using the foam lips and start it&amp;#39;s not  going to clean the guide for the flange  when it knocks the point there so when  it gets to this size you can actually  get in the groove and actually clean the  inside of the rail also where they are  lever for where the track moves for the  point itself and also there so that  comes in handy so and you can also if  you don&amp;#39;t have in a bad size yet because  you can also shape it with the sandpaper  to access the very types corners but  other than that that&amp;#39;s how I clean the  track  thank you guys for watching that video I  hope that was helpful for you playing  your own 9-volt Lego train tracks</text><text start="6.04" dur="3.54"></text><text start="7.42" dur="3.839"></text><text start="9.58"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.88" dur="3.44">i&amp;#39;m going to show you how you can lay a  concrete pad now these can be used for  driveways or paths but the one we&amp;#39;re  laying today  is for a shed  first you have to decide where your  shed&amp;#39;s going to sit you need to allow  enough distance from hedges or fences  now the shed i&amp;#39;m going to build is 1.8  by 1.5 this timber will be the boxing  for our concrete pad i&amp;#39;ve already  pre-cut my timber to length i&amp;#39;m using  100 by 25 rough sawn untreated timber  i&amp;#39;m now going to nail the boxing  together i&amp;#39;m using 75mm nails  just leave your nails sticking out a  little way when we take the boxing off  it&amp;#39;s going to make it nice and easy  now i&amp;#39;m just going to make sure that our  boxing is nice and square  to do this i&amp;#39;m just going to measure the  diagonals and ensure both ways are  exactly the same dimension  2472  spot on  next thing you want to do is dazzle  around the outside edge of your boxing  our concrete pad requires 75 millimeters  of compacted base coarse underneath 75  millimeters of concrete there are  different depths of pads for different  jobs check mitre10&amp;#39;s online guide for  the correct pad for your project now the  pad can be level with the ground or  raised above it we want our concrete pad  level with the ground so this means we  need to remove 150 millimeters of soil  to allow for the compacted base coarse  and concrete  the boxing is pegged in place  sure the boxing is level so the shed  sits flat then fix the pegs to the  boxing  and then just rake and remove any loose  dirt  because our concrete pad is for a shed  we&amp;#39;ve decided to put in a rebate this is  for the walls of the shed to slot onto  right now we can put in our base course  and this is your chance to hire a  compactor they&amp;#39;re really easy to use  next we add a layer of sand and then  we&amp;#39;re going to give it a rake  the sand will fill in the holes in the  base course making a nice smooth surface  now it&amp;#39;s time for the polythene make  sure you tuck it in neatly  a pad this size doesn&amp;#39;t really need mesh  but i&amp;#39;m going to add it anyway just to  show you how it&amp;#39;s  done we&amp;#39;re using little concrete blocks  to hold the mesh off the polythene so it  sits in the middle of the concrete slab  time for the main event mix your  concrete and a mixer according to the  instructions and then pour it into the  boxing  i&amp;#39;ve tapped the boxing to settle the  concrete and get the air bubbles out  for the first stage of the finishing  process i&amp;#39;m using this formal one to  screed it off next we&amp;#39;re going to use  the magnesium trowel this stops drawing  the water up and out of the concrete  and finally a steel trowel to give us a  nice smooth finish  wait between one to two hours and then  repeat this final step for an even  smoother finish  now we just need to wait for the  concrete to cure keep an eye on it  concrete that dries too fast can crack  or shrink so you may want to give it a  light spray with the hose in sunny  conditions for something this size  you&amp;#39;ll need to leave it for around 48  hours  right now it&amp;#39;s time to take our boxing  off first thing you want to do  just give the boxing a light tap this  will make it easier to remove  take our screws out of the pegs  now we&amp;#39;ll just pull our nails  out of the boxing that we left sticking  out  and just very gently  lift that up  and there&amp;#39;s our finished pad with rebate  ready for our shed to fit onto easy as  for all the help and advice you need to  get the job done just head down to mitre  10.</text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="10.15" dur="9.759">[Applause]  [Music]  what are you doing in there what you&amp;#39;re  smoking man I&amp;#39;m not smoking I&amp;#39;m  breathing someone comment down below she  doesn&amp;#39;t anyways guys if you are new to  the channel we&amp;#39;re gonna finally take  Kennedy for ride in the 2018 Mustang GT  that is single turbo so here&amp;#39;s the thing  if you guys are new to the channel this  is my 2018 Mustang gt500 is the 10 speed  automatic it has a single turbo kit that  we custom made but however it is not  hitting full boost right now because it  actually has a lot of back pressure  issues so if you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with  coyotes they flow a shit-ton through the  heads and actually this turbo is either  a too small or B we&amp;#39;ve actually found  out that the exhaust might be too small  or that the valve spring is actually  opening up because of the back pressure  issue so or the can&amp;#39;t open up or  something I don&amp;#39;t know anyways it&amp;#39;s got  back pressure issues so we actually  don&amp;#39;t have that much power it hits like  10 pounds and then falls off to like 3  or 4 but we&amp;#39;re gonna finally take  Kennedy for a ride I took her for a ride  the other day but we didn&amp;#39;t film it so  I&amp;#39;m gonna fill it for you guys so you  can see her reaction but this is our  custom single turbo kit not many people  do single turbos for the backpressure  reasons but we&amp;#39;ve got a lethal  performance full triple fuel pump system  so it&amp;#39;s got dual Aeromotive fuel  pressure regulators got a custom foil  catch-can on there 1050 ID injectors  7675 precision t4 turbo all custom  piping by dee Joseph young tile blah  valve  dual tile 44 millimeter wastegates  Treadstone 13 doors  stocking those doctrines pretty cool huh  pretty nice so that&amp;#39;s my Mustang piss  Scott it&amp;#39;s kind of a ghetto build right  now these are none other than actually  okay here&amp;#39;s the thing these aren&amp;#39;t even  om Hellcat wheels these are Hellcat reps  from Kevin&amp;#39;s car so Kevin had sold his  om Hellcat wheels actually a long time  ago and then we decided when we had held  cats we wanted the stock wheels again so  we bought reps because they&amp;#39;re really an  expensive plus when you get the rep you  can actually get a wider wheel say I&amp;#39;m  more of a patch two foot down but these  are none other than OEM Hellcat replica  wheels wrapped in some Mickey Thompson  PT Street ssso I haven&amp;#39;t got drag  radials yet and we had these sitting  around at the house so I figured why not  use it and we&amp;#39;ve got no back seat I need  to finish the wiring back there for the  trip but let&amp;#39;s take Kennedy for rent all  right David&amp;#39;s gonna start her up for us  quiet and slow  all right so we are back on the GoPro we  are in sport mode see if we can get into  Oh  that turn trash cans you can have any  traction zero traction  aka the button that looks for crowds  also we can&amp;#39;t go too far cuz it&amp;#39;s on C  16 and 1/16 very expensive and I don&amp;#39;t  have any that&amp;#39;s all I got  hey David touch her in a stop sign we&amp;#39;re  all there one two three okay  oh I love the downside sounds so my trip  and else you turn green  [Music]  yeah so like I said it&amp;#39;s got back fresh  issues so it hits and then it falls off  so it&amp;#39;s like fun and then more fun and  more fun of fasteners  and sounds really pretty  I start to get used to your exhaust it&amp;#39;s  like right in my view yeah so it makes  it kind of hazy on the windshield  on your side not much  that was a motorcycle not legs off  although they sound very similar  [Music]  the guy&amp;#39;s jacket says prospect  [Music]  he was a guy  prospect over here sons of anarchy  put together some  last time the lady was telling me how  her son just got his license if he wants  a nice day  and then she saw the exhaust like well  he&amp;#39;s got to save up for that one  a long time at all is that right now if  he got one something pill that&amp;#39;s free  that&amp;#39;s funny  three turns  holla  well I&amp;#39;ll get a bang you&amp;#39;re gonna get a  bang yeah  it&amp;#39;s like a week old  purple Bubba pair please  that&amp;#39;s disgusting I get a large diet dr.  pepper and a purple guava

I need hold Debus  hopefully we are probably gonna try I  haven&amp;#39;t talked about this yet except for  there in the video but and then we&amp;#39;re  gonna try a bigger exhaust I just don&amp;#39;t  know if it&amp;#39;s worth it plus there&amp;#39;s not  that much room in the engine bay as is  so you know it&amp;#39;d have to be a five inch  exhaust but I did speak to someone over  the weekend that made a thousand wheel  horsepower on this turbo on a coyote  he just had valve springs and a five  inch exhaust I just don&amp;#39;t know where we  put a five inch exhaust but hopefully  guys enjoyed this video make sure was  comment like subscribe follow Kennedy at  Kennedy but call on an Instagram follow  me on Bambi thirty nine and we&amp;#39;re  actually we&amp;#39;re

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.1" dur="5.99">castles dominated the medieval landscape  and Britain has some of the finest in  the world  today most are decaying relics many of  their secrets buried in time  [Music]  now historian Ruth Goodman and  archaeologists Tom painful compete again  are turning the clock back to relearn  the secrets of the medieval castle  builders this is the ultimate medieval  technology  the origin of our customs is distinctly  French introduced to Britain at the time  of the Norman conquest of 1066  [Music]  here in the Burgundy region of France is  get along castle  the world&amp;#39;s biggest archaeological  experiment  a 25 year project to build a castle from  scratch using the same tools techniques  and materials available in the 13th  century it&amp;#39;s a lot of hard work and  coalface because this is industry for  the next six months  Ruth Peter and Tom will experience the  daily rigors of medieval construction  drop-down and everyday life how workers  dressed and the art of combat  [Music]  this is the story of how to build a  medieval castle  [Music]  it&amp;#39;s May and the team have been immersed  in the building works alongside getting  ons Masons they&amp;#39;ve learned how the  castle was defended in times of war  [Music]  every stone has to be annoying because  this is it now up and are enough now the  team discovered a surprisingly colorful  world of 13th century castle interiors  and much of the material they work with  will come straight from the ground some  of the stuff in here is ochre from paint  to brighten the rooms look at the  difference on those fingers - turning  mud into floor tiles  can you imagine living in a world with  no electric lights and they&amp;#39;ll be  rediscovering an ancient art in a  midnight firing at the kiln  [Music]  the medieval castles were used to seeing  today a scarred by centuries of warfare  and weather erosion  [Music]  most of their original roofs carpentry  and interior finishes have long since  disappeared  but these drab walls are a far cry from  how they looked in their heyday  [Music]  this is how many of us think of the  interior of castles bare stone echoey  damp gritty underfoot but that&amp;#39;s because  we&amp;#39;re used to ruins when they were in  use back in the 13th century they were  rather different you have to imagine  tiled floors and plaster on the walls  perhaps painted white washed and then  hangings of fabric over the top filled  with furniture and that too is covered  in fabrics cushions all sorts an  entirely different beast  [Music]  to strive for accuracy the get-along  project has adopted a specific  historical timeframe to work to the  castle is being designed and built as it  would have been in the fronts of the  twelve 30s and 40s during the reign of  King Louie the ninth  [Music]  the region of quiz a in Burgundy was  governed by one jean de to see a vassal  to the king in turn the to see was the  overlord of several other lower ranking  noblemen and it was one of these lesser  nobles who would have commissioned a  castle like the one being built here at  get along today it&amp;#39;s not a grand royal  castle bristling with military might  enormous wealth but a fortified  residence of relatively modest taste and  design according to the rank and means  of the imaginary lord of gettin on the  team along with site administrator sarah  preston are exploring some of the key  rooms and quarters within the castle to  find out how the interiors are being  dressed this is the castles Great Hall  great is the word so this is very much  the hub of castle life this is it&amp;#39;s a  dining hall it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a banqueting for  feasting hall in this room it&amp;#39;s a  statement of power and prestige isn&amp;#39;t it  absolutely which is what it&amp;#39;s important  to bear in mind of course once it&amp;#39;s  finished we won&amp;#39;t have these bare stone  walls the Great Hall was the political  and business hub of castle life this was  where the Lord held court receiving his  tenants and listening to their concerns  and grievances  with many of the social rituals of the  day being held here it was important for  the interior design to show off his  wealth and status to invited guests over  the next few years the Great Hall at get  along and the great tower adjacent to it  will be dressed in the style of a 13th  century Lord and his lady so this is  currently the Lord&amp;#39;s chamber this is  where the Lord would sleep with his wife  and his children it&amp;#39;s certainly a  residential chamber you can see that  from the fireplace on the hall behind us  so can you heat it that&amp;#39;s not true of  all the castle the stone walls are rough  uneven and drafty but they would have  been dressed and painted  Peter and tongue are going to be  painting and tiling some of the castles  indoor spaces while Ruth makes paint but  first sarah takes her to the already  decorated kitchen under the Great Hall  but eventually it will have render  applied and then a lime wash it with  much whiter and brighter you have a look  oh I see what you mean  I mean that&amp;#39;s real darkness into light  isn&amp;#39;t it it makes such a difference  people aren&amp;#39;t used to necessarily seeing  me inside of castle walls rendered and  lime washed but it&amp;#39;s made such a  difference to the people actually work  in the kitchen because it&amp;#39;s sort of Bank  salt has an electric light absolutely  and I guess in terms of Hygiene it would  have made a difference oh yeah  definitely  really it sort of kills anything that  might be there and stops bugs getting  into all the cracks and things so you  start with a really sterile surface  repaint if you don&amp;#39;t whenever you need  to I mean obviously so far we haven&amp;#39;t  had the time to render the inside of all  the rooms we&amp;#39;ve got other priorities at  the moment but as soon as we finished  kind of major building work then we can  get on with the job of rendering the  inside but I hope also the outside of  the castle because often the outsides of  castles were also rendered and lime  washed because in terms of visibility it  just meant that your castle stood out in  the landscape so that&amp;#39;s something that  we couldn&amp;#39;t necessarily get away with in  a genuine historic monument but here on  this experimental site that&amp;#39;s something  that we can show our visitors the Tower  of London the White Tower was named  because it was lime washed on the  outside  [Music]  the tower nearest the quarry known as  the quarry tower would have been a  guardroom or shooting gallery even this  would have been brightly decorated the  boys have been tasked by stonemason for  Eastman girl with rendering the interior  wall with lime mortar the medieval  equivalent of plaster we&amp;#39;re gonna use  two-and-a-half buckets of sand and one  lime and water and mix it in what we&amp;#39;re  looking for here is the right  consistency keep on adding a little more  moisture Turnitin Turnitin  it&amp;#39;s okay are you happy good enough he&amp;#39;s  good yeah  cozy workspace a breeze demonstrates our  medieval wall is rendered but some water  should not drench their bare army she&amp;#39;s  banding this time if she don&amp;#39;t put  footer  archaeological research has revealed  that rendering wouldn&amp;#39;t have been  applied in several smooth layers but  with a single ruff [ __ ] using a  technique similar to spreading butter  [Music]  I&amp;#39;m gonna learn from your mistakes so to  do a turret like this how long do you  think would take - tweeting - three days  ten days as the lime mortar is  relatively porous it will draw out any  dampness in the wall and so help to  preserve the masonry underneath  it&amp;#39;s interesting isn&amp;#39;t it we&amp;#39;re only  putting on one coats that butter coats  but this is an established practice  isn&amp;#39;t it you always think when you go to  the ruined castles in the UK or around  Europe these bare walls and what they  were looking at however not the case it  was a prestige thing to get a layer  render up decorate it yeah I mean  castles majority casters they are just  ruins on that you&amp;#39;re coming to them very  long after their lives  the medieval manufacturer of tiles for  castle roofs and floor spaces was an  industry in itself so far I get along  28,000 tiles have been created for the  roof of the Great Hall building alone a  job which took four years to achieve  it&amp;#39;s estimated that a total of 80,000  times will be needed to cover the roofs  of the castle in its entirety but as the  four towers around the curtain wall are  still on the construction tile  production is now shifted from roof  tiles to floor times when tom is about  to discover just how laborious the  process is to make just one tile it&amp;#39;s  breaking up some of this clay I&amp;#39;m gonna  use it for our tiles obviously not in  this state we actually need to get a lot  of these impurities out but some of the  stuff in here is ochre ochre can  actually turn into paint  so when separate some of that out now  just stack up on this clay get it back  to the twe Lurie or the tile makers in  the 11th century many Hamlet&amp;#39;s and  villages in France  specialized in tile production to meet  increasing demand from the local  nobility and as the medieval tile trade  grew so did the strict regulations it  was governed by designed to standardize  production let&amp;#39;s see about clay isn&amp;#39;t he  not easy to work feel all the muscles  get involved in 1280 a decree from  Toulouse stipulated that good tiles may  only be made from well pug clay  well trampled underfoot and not over dry  feels nice lace is this good for hands  good for skin very nice for the skin  yeah some people are paying for this  lucky us  I&amp;#39;ve always wanted soft hands Tom and  tile maker Emmerich we are now removing  any twigs and stones and making the clay  homogeneous and malleable so this hard  lump here this could be oka yes the  ochre pigments contain colorful iron  oxides and a set aside to be used for  making paint  [Music]  an integral feature of castle design  with the toilets they were known as  Garda home the French word for wardrobe  clothes would often be kept inside them  because it was believed the smell of  ammonia from urine kept parasites at bay  Garda Hogg were often built out of the  castle walls to allow the waste to drop  down through the hole to the ground or  moat below  [Music]  get-along keeps the wooden grille over  the holes to dissuade any modern-day  visitors from attempting to spend a  penny it&amp;#39;s a big question isn&amp;#39;t it how  people use guard ropes there is little  bits of evidence in the earliest of the  manors books which are aimed at pages  who are serving a night hoping to become  a scribe become a knight so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s  for little lads you know their first job  of the day before their Lord is up is to  prepare the Privy and he&amp;#39;s told to make  it extremely clean he&amp;#39;s got to sweep it  down and make it clean he&amp;#39;s also got to  put cloths in there not quite sure how  the cloths were used but they&amp;#39;re to go  in there and sweet-smelling  herbs yeah so that it&amp;#39;s somewhere  comfortable and pleasant to be so at  least for those at the very top of  society going to the toilet ought to  have been quite a nice experience yeah I  think I mean they wouldn&amp;#39;t smell too bad  I mean I know the poos going down and  yes if it&amp;#39;s not getting moved there  might be a bit of wafting up but those  herbs has certainly taken the edge off  and there is of course the question of  toilet paper curries  I mean many people think leaves the moss  but let&amp;#39;s face it deforestation where  the heck are you gonna get a leaf of the  right size of the middle of January I  read obviously and then you also you  think more moths but you&amp;#39;d have to have  most plantation these wouldn&amp;#39;t you to  keep a big community it&amp;#39;s very very dry  sauna so I&amp;#39;m there&amp;#39;s nothing to say that  people didn&amp;#39;t use I mean you know as  well as I do that archaeologically all  sorts of things turn up instead  spits so probably people use whatever  was to hand but I do wonder if maybe the  more normal system especially in a  castle would have been to have your own  cloth or rag or flannel to wash yourself  with for even a communal rag wash it out  in a bucket washed out in a bucket it&amp;#39;s  perfectly possible for these privies  anyway sunny use a coat of render coach  the lime wash probably a loose seats I  think adore might be a good idea to the  wall  so you have to take some this fingers  grease is dripping you have to take it  on your finger like this  um that&amp;#39;s for cake just work that round  and that&amp;#39;s actually lubricate the side  but the template is it  yeah the toil will come out easily at  the end so I like to start with hands  because you we can feel you can feel all  the corners it&amp;#39;s very important to have  good corners in your child if not the  Masons really not satisfied is very hard  for them we don&amp;#39;t have said Mason&amp;#39;s no  don&amp;#39;t do that so you can use this as  well when you think the donors are okay  you can finish you know just hissing now  Eve looks like you&amp;#39;re rolling a bit  there yeah a little bit if you like do  you like this right okay  so much like she&amp;#39;s not questing it&amp;#39;s off  as you make Congrats  here with me in between you two you tool  you use this one like this and try to  get something very flats  so we have to to see if it&amp;#39;s okay on the  other side when there&amp;#39;s opponents always  with the conus or with something with  the comers so I got to check the corners  okay  my Connors are good what if this is  perfect  oh yeah yes yes my sons will be happy  okay you put it&amp;#39;s there and you do like  this with the grease poke family it is  going but you have to sign with the name  of this race and basically that&amp;#39;s what  quality control yes and we&amp;#39;ll be done  once we got another 69 to do yes  [Laughter]  [Music]  just beyond the castle walls Ruth is  visiting get Allen&amp;#39;s paint house to  discover how the ochre found in the  quarry and in the clay is used to make  pigments for paint  [Music]  I&amp;#39;m gonna start by grinding down the  earth valeriy earth toe is a ceramicist  by trade from a family of local potters  she&amp;#39;s in charge of pigments painting and  decoration that get us so these are the  pieces the Tom was finding in amongst  acclaim he was doing the tiling at once  if I could overlap here like we&amp;#39;re done  will appear we&amp;#39;re not gonna pop paints  funny stuff it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the same as  dye dye stains the fibers of what you&amp;#39;re  dying so so if you get a wood stain that  is a die for wood because it&amp;#39;s dying the  wood fibers in the same way as cross  there&amp;#39;s a dye that stains the fibers  paint it&amp;#39;s different  pain is bits of colored stuff that are  glued onto a surface and so if they&amp;#39;re  very big lumps the amount of light  coming off is quite small the color  looks patchy and thin if you can make  the particles very very tiny the light  will refract off them in a great burst  and you&amp;#39;ll get a really strong intense  color I mean I shouldn&amp;#39;t think a 13th  century person thought about light  refraction but they did know that if you  grind it thoroughly you get a much  better paint good against yellow a  yellow still on their yellow ochre is  the other key color found in the natural  get annoyed bone no Caminos this really  is the color of gathering look at her  when you&amp;#39;re around here everything&amp;#39;s  this color absolutely everything that is  the dust that we breathe in whenever you  get anywhere near the castle it sorts  grinds underfoot it&amp;#39;s the know just look  at the place this is the color of the  ground so having sort of crushed it up a  bit and dissolved it we&amp;#39;re now sitting  in we want  all particles as the mixture settles the  heavier ochre particles fall to the  bottom and the remaining liquid is left  out in the Sun to dry the finer  particles left behind are then ground  down into a powder enormous amount of  work to grind this down to the finest  that you need but when you just see the  range of colors that be produced just  out of the earth of get-along you can  see why people would bother just look at  it  aunt in the castle courtyard Peter and  Philippe de l&amp;#39;arche known to his fellow  craftspeople as Gandalf like a mixing  lime wash made with one part lime and  one part water where is that in French  language  leadership Oh milk milk of lime  how can you tell it&amp;#39;s good consistency  all right there&amp;#39;s more than oratory is  that that&amp;#39;s good yeah  should be enough yep I&amp;#39;ll grab that  bucket  yes up sau Peter heads towards the Lord  and lady&amp;#39;s bedchamber in the great tower  to brighten things up in the garden in  French and then it&amp;#39;s down down down and  it just gives a beautiful beautiful  texture I know it get long there&amp;#39;s a  massive debate as to whether you know  they should leave the stones the walls  there because all this work had gone in  by the Masons to to put the stone there  and they say if you cover up with mortar  if we work with render and painted with  I wash the public won&amp;#39;t see it but this  is how the council&amp;#39;s wearing medieval  age course as we come across castles  their ruins generally very little  plaster work survives  [Music]  Ruthie&amp;#39;s and valerie experiment with a  bit of 13th century chemistry so this is  the local yellow ocher weight and we&amp;#39;re  cooking it askew veteran your push to  try to turn it red it&amp;#39;s quite exciting  isn&amp;#39;t it this just comes out of the  ground all yellow and you can get this  range of colors no you did this yeah oh  yeah yes you&amp;#39;re right I can see yeah  well it&amp;#39;s hot look at the difference on  my fingers yellow ochre is a hydrated  iron oxide known as limonite as it  heated over the fire some of the  limonite turns into hematite turning the  ochre into rich darker shades such as  burnt sienna and burnt umber pigments is  a really ancient right across Europe if  you think of those cave paintings right  at the dawn of human history this is the  sort of paint that they were using to  make them and if you think of Britain  the pigs I think those people are no  more described in the ancient Roman  texts as being covered in red paint the  red men and they Irish talked about it  it seems to have been a really celtic  thing to do to paint yourself  look  [Music]  just beyond the castle walls of Goodell  oh the earth and kill used for the  firing of tiles is lined with bricks  kilns were often owned by the local Lord  who of course charged his tenants for  using them in a 13th century regulations  governing the work of local tyler&amp;#39;s in  and around Toulouse specified not only  the consistency and dimensions of the  tiles themselves but also the size of  the kilns used and the number of tiles  permitted to be fired in any one firing  get-along fires 4,000 tiles at a time  [Music]  Bruno Favaro is the chief tile maker at  gettin all and he and his team have  presided over 15 experimental firings  during the past nine years each firing  has enabled them to improve and finesse  their techniques  [Music]  the way they&amp;#39;re placing them in the kiln  they&amp;#39;re leaving gaps so that when they  fire this the flames can work their way  up through every single tile and  hopefully we win even temperature making  each one hard each one a very similar  color and and making sure there&amp;#39;s no  losses in one of the problems with these  tiles when you dry them out if there&amp;#39;s  any water in there and you fire it too  quickly the kiln that water expand does  it turn into a gas blow the toilet park  you&amp;#39;ll hear a pop and if these are  stacked incorrectly if one tile goes  several tiles could go they&amp;#39;ve been  doing this for a number of years they  know what they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s a lot of  this is trial and error experiment so I  killed you they they they know what  these kilns look like from excavations  have been done in the UK done in France  now they know how these kilns actually  worked because they&amp;#39;ve been working  these kilns  [Music]  out in the peace and quiet of the forest  Ruth is making an essential tool for  applying her medieval paint so if I&amp;#39;m  actually going to be able to paint  anything that looks like something I&amp;#39;m  going to need a decent brush to do it  with so I went and found some badger  here well I&amp;#39;ll be honest there was a  there was some roadkill so I shaved it I  know it sounds a bit but weighted  tainted too so I shaved it as close to  the skin as I possibly could in order to  keep the hairs all as they grow  naturally in order so when I sort of  grab a little tuft of it here if I sort  of try to separate a bit out and what I  want are these long straight hairs that  are what helps a badger shared water the  hair is designed to move water which is  why it makes such great brushes I&amp;#39;m  going to glue those hairs in place so  they don&amp;#39;t move during the next bit of  the process the glue booth is using is  gum arabic hardens self from the acacia  tree mixed with four parts water  gum arabic of course is water-soluble so  I&amp;#39;ll be able to just wash it out of the  brush at the end and can you see how  that&amp;#39;s coming together now as a point  that&amp;#39;s exactly what I wanted to do as a  finished brush if you look at a modern  paint brush there&amp;#39;s this sort of metal  bit between the hairs and the stick the  13th century ago no I&amp;#39;m not gonna mess  around trying to make a metal ferrule  you just do something much much easier  and cheaper you go and get yourself a  feather because if you think about it if  I cut that bit off and I cut that bit  off I&amp;#39;ve got a ready-made tube I can  take a little bit of thread and bind my  hairs it&amp;#39;s whipping them into place  that&amp;#39;s tight as I can manage and I&amp;#39;ve  got a nice firmly held with a paintbrush  head I should be able to poke through  there we go and see how firming that&amp;#39;s  in there now  see don&amp;#39;t brush head all I need now is  jammer stick in the other end done that  looks like it&amp;#39;ll work on it  the pressures on at the tile kiln the  13th of May in medieval France was  regarded as the day of the Holi I see it  was believed to be the last day of  spring in which a hailstorm would occur  sent by God as a sign of his omnipotence  before the arrival of summer  and as Hale often turns quickly to heavy  rain that could have disastrous  consequences for the fate of this batch  of tiles this firing has already been  held up for several days  owing to heavy storms and once again  dark clouds are looming overhead  the rain is coming and we&amp;#39;ve just got to  get this finished because if these tiles  get wet it&amp;#39;ll be a serious problem not  only can it affect their abilities fire  since you know they may explode if if  the water gets in there you also take an  awful lot more fuel to dry this kiln out  and then get it up to temperature  medieval tile makers would probably use  mud earth or wooden boards to  weatherproof the tops of their kilns but  for reasons of practicality and  efficiency  get-along relies on sheets of 21st  century corrugated iron there isn&amp;#39;t a  moment to lose here it comes the holy  ice the year you will get hail and  almost as if on cue as feared the hail  quickly turns into a downpour  the kiln will remain covetous several  days to allow the soil around it and the  wood required for firing time to  thoroughly dry out  only once Bruno has assessed at the  ground and climate conditions are  optimal  well the firing finally take place and  at this rate it may have to be postponed  for several more days yet glad I&amp;#39;ve got  poncho Tomo  [Music]  [Music]  while the tile firing is unhold  progress is made on the chapel tower the  guardroom within the lower floor is  undergoing a colorful transformation  Valerie and her colleague aurélie paya  are using the gedan on ochre to paint a  design on the walls known as fictive  masonry this was a popular style of  artwork among the nobility and royalty  throughout Europe in the mid 13th  century it was a less expensive way to  create the illusion of the walls having  been constructed from expensive white  limestone by lime washing the cheaper  sandstone white and then over painting  this with a colorful fake stonework  pattern a look at grandeur and of wealth  was created  to think it goes from best I surrender  on to like mush to this and Isis  prestige is 1240 Queen of England has  something very similar in a bed chambers  with addition of flowers but no  brightens the room doesn&amp;#39;t it is like  visual is impressive and these fake  joints made out of this ochre paint give  the impression of highly carved stone  exactly so it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re replicating  what&amp;#39;s beneath with a very stylish way  no way that actually says to people come  here to visit this is what I&amp;#39;m worth  I&amp;#39;ve got money I can make this happen  the ochre pigments would be mixed with a  glue binder made from egg or sometimes  rabbit skin to make the paint is dark  enough oh I think I top loaded my  brushes that were too much there yeah it  hasn&amp;#39;t run that&amp;#39;s the danger isn&amp;#39;t it  too much pigment on you your brow at all  sniffing man no no miss what then wrong  it&amp;#39;s going wrong it&amp;#39;s looking awful it  is yeah I&amp;#39;ve seen worse but  [Music]  [Music]  every aspect of Gatlin&amp;#39;s design is  planned by a scientific committee of  experts  they work closely with the staff so that  every feature is based on authentic  primary sources of historical evidence  and just a few miles away in the village  of loot here is a key example of that  evidence the Church of st. Peter built  around the Year 1000  the Church of the Middle Ages was a huge  and wealthy landowner which exerted a  powerful influence over people&amp;#39;s lives  and the interiors of its buildings often  set a benchmark for the tastes and  trends of the era in the early 1980s the  white distemper covering the interior  walls started to crack appeal this is  amazing uncovering a fascinating  medieval secret everywhere  a painstaking conservation over the next  10 years revealed these stunning ochre  murals from the 13th century they&amp;#39;ve  provided get along with an authentic and  illuminating resource from which to draw  inspiration for the interior decor of  the castle this is the panel that we&amp;#39;re  particularly interested in terms of the  work we&amp;#39;re doing it getting on it&amp;#39;s  amazing you can see you can pick out  there you can see the frieze yeah at  least five petal flowers you find these  all over the place very pop up but it&amp;#39;s  pure 13th century of course the church  should have been absolutely essential in  people&amp;#39;s lives and everyone locally  would have had to have come to this  church so the paintings on these walls  aren&amp;#39;t just decoration they are here to  tell stories they can be read very much  like a cartoon strip it&amp;#39;s almost the  entertainment of the age the biblical  story just laid out in scenes and I like  the way that the artists have also taken  the opportunity to retell the story in  their way if there was any kind of  friction for three men in a church  we&amp;#39;ve got Eve here rushing away being  very cheeky given the wink to Adam  here they have a a wink we can&amp;#39;t see  what happens behind the pillar and then  afterwards they&amp;#39;ve got a harvest and a  child so I wonder what the reaction was  because up resumee the villagers would  be in on the joke  are you leaving you  [Music]  Ruth is applying some of the techniques  discovered at the Church of San Peter to  the bedchamber which would have been  used to provide hospitality to the Lord  and ladies most distinguished guests  it&amp;#39;s the most highly decorated room in  the castle so far and Ruth is using the  burnt red ochre paint to restore the  Rose motifs in the window seat obviously  the domestic spaces within a castle are  intended to impress they have to look  gorgeous it&amp;#39;s about the look of the  place as much as anything else and  naturally people painted their walls  it&amp;#39;s not a church  this isn&amp;#39;t about religious storytelling  this was about showing your power it was  about prestige that up there that little  bit where it&amp;#39;s painted to look as if  it&amp;#39;s masonry with the little roses in  front often cool stones and roses is  perhaps the most typical as far as we  can tell of all interior decorating  designs of the mid 13th century that is  what the Queen of England had on her  bedroom walls in the Tower of London  stones and roses the very height of  fashion  [Music]  back at the Church of San Peter  Moochie ser explains how the paintings  on these walls have informed the way in  which get on ins interiors are decorated  [Music]  because we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of evidence  of the types of paintings that were  inside castles we were always very  careful to say to people okay we don&amp;#39;t  know if there was ever a bedroom painted  in exactly the style that we&amp;#39;ve got with  the castle that&amp;#39;s just a stone&amp;#39;s throw  from the castle at the same time we&amp;#39;re  painting these same patterns and  crucially it&amp;#39;s the same color palette  this is just like walking out of the  quarry and you&amp;#39;ve got the red oak the  the yellow ochre is the Browns I have to  say I mean you look at the Masons when  they come out for quarry and that kind  of the dust and the ochre it&amp;#39;s on them  that is your color palette absolutely no  it&amp;#39;s everything&amp;#39;s there so if we wanted  to paint in this area it with blues or  greens we&amp;#39;d have to buy those pigments  him from further afield and they would  have been more costly and it&amp;#39;s  interesting to see that in a church the  decision has obviously been taken not to  have too much blue or green they&amp;#39;ve used  the materials that were available  locally Oh like this just doesn&amp;#39;t really  survive and castles castles gem ruins  but church is there&amp;#39;s such a an  important historical reference that was  certainly a challenge for us and that we  were aware that there are very few  models of the types of paintings that  they would have been inside castles at  this time it was a very deliberate  decision not to use the human figures  because obviously these are depicting  biblical stories so we stuck very much  with the the flowers the trees the  geometric shapes but what we&amp;#39;re wanting  to do is offer people a vision of what a  13th century visitor might have seen and  to get over the fact that the castles  weren&amp;#39;t pear stone empty places they  were decorated and they were full of  color  [Music]  another area of the castle which is the  result of intense research into 13th  century architecture is the chapel  Clement Gerard  the chief stone carver again along is a  highly experienced draftsman but he&amp;#39;s  about to undertake his most ambitious  project to date by now Clemens doing the  drawing for what will be the prestige  feature of the chapel so much so they&amp;#39;ve  actually imported a slightly less higher  type of limestone but were easier to  carve this really is precise work I am  marveling at the skill he&amp;#39;s got  [Music]  Lemoine is designing a decorative piece  of masonry  based on a very common 13th century  design found throughout France it&amp;#39;s a  niche for the chapel wall with a trefoil  shaped head which will sit upon pillars  rising from two small basins called  piscine Agudelo white dress limestone is  used for the more decorative features of  the castle although it&amp;#39;s cricket  addressed on the quarries hard sandstone  it&amp;#39;s easier to chip so great precision  is required and the stakes could prove  costly  [Music]  finally it&amp;#39;s the morning of the  long-awaited firing of the kiln  Peter&amp;#39;s up early to help share the  workload but fly under one the firebox  in the lower chamber has been stacked  with logs and twigs  and at last the first piece of kindling  is  within seconds clouds of wood smoke are  billowing out at the top of the fire  engine  it&amp;#39;s going to take hundreds of armfuls  of wood and many hours of careful  monitoring to turn these flames into the  roaring blaze required to fire the tiles  a long hot and exhausting day lies ahead  [Music]  the stone carvers have completed the  first part the white limestone leash and  are ready to transport it at the chapel  tower the hoisting of the stone requires  care and attention the Lord and all of  those working for him would have set  great store by this sacred work of art  [Music]  but for us the significance is that this  is the first real piece of religious  architecture that we&amp;#39;ve got in the  castle this is the the only sacred space  within the castle so we&amp;#39;re actually  standing here in the area where the  altar will be so this is the holiest  place right this is sacred space well  you&amp;#39;d have Miley water on your wheels  yeah so that this is the most delicate  sculpture that we&amp;#39;ve done here as you  can see it&amp;#39;s a hand base and you&amp;#39;ve seen  it being being dressed earlier you can  see the two dips now we had some priests  visiting as we were wondering ourselves  why there were these two kind of  recesses and the priests that were  visiting suggested that maybe one was  for washing priest hands before the mass  and that the other one was them for  washing the influence that have been  used in the mass what we&amp;#39;ve been told at  least is that the idea is that all the  water that is in this this bosina this  this what hand basin is holy water and  as such you can&amp;#39;t just be thrown away  all the water will actually and we&amp;#39;re  not sowing about huge amounts that the  water will just kind of filter down into  the wall and stay within the the stone  of the chapel itself is obvious of  course it&amp;#39;s gonna absorb a holy water  and essentially make this whole space  even more sacred so a little mini little  temple here at get long so it&amp;#39;s been an  opportunity obviously for the  stonemasons to use different techniques  and then it was a little bit of  improvisation never that gave that the  stonemasons an opportunity to to kind of  have a bit of freedom of movement you  can see each column is slightly  different  this is matches you can see his mark up  here on the stone and on the other side  we&amp;#39;ve got John Paul&amp;#39;s thank you  [Music]  the Masons marx undressed stones are a  permanent reminder of the ancient skills  and techniques of the medieval Masons  each one presents us with a unique  signature of the craftsman who carved a  particular piece  [Music]  [Laughter]  [Music]  at the kiln tension is rising a month&amp;#39;s  rain has taken its toll and the firing  is not going to plan everything of wet  the kiln got wet the wood got wet so  it&amp;#39;s just taking that a little bit  longer to draw everything out get rid of  the moisture the blaze is still several  hundred degrees below what it needs to  be peter leads a frantic effort to try  to save the four thousand tiles inside  [Music]  we know today the optimum temperature  for successful firing is around 1,000  degrees centigrade  thirteenth-century Tyler&amp;#39;s relied on  their experience their senses and costly  trial and error they would have been  under intense pressure to get firings  right  [Music]  the kiln it&amp;#39;s just about getting up to  temperature now ready to really feed up  that&amp;#39;s pretty soon those tiles we&amp;#39;re  getting close to firing but it does mean  it&amp;#39;s gonna be a longer day I mean the  Sun is setting in the sky we&amp;#39;re gonna go  late into the night  a tireless trade depended on the local  nobility&amp;#39;s trust and the reliability of  his product and the strict laws  governing the standards of production  were rigidly enforced tiles must be  correctly stacked the temperature must  not be too high too low the heat must be  distributed evenly throughout the kiln  if not the results could be under fire  over fired or otherwise damaged tiles  and the medieval Lord would neither  accept nor pay for a single substandard  tile failed firing had serious  consequences for a tireless livelihood  [Music]  as darkness falls Peter and the team  finally succeed in getting the  temperature up to 1,000 degrees  centigrade  we&amp;#39;ve been working since this morning  without stopping and now we are big time  it was because our but now it&amp;#39;s such a  good temperature right  what&amp;#39;s your ecology looking for it must  stay  arranged all right if it&amp;#39;s white it&amp;#39;s  too much if it ones the ties to be fired  evenly we must stay at this temperature  doing two hours all right  but are you happy yes yes we are  it&amp;#39;s a dream  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  can you imagine living in a world with  no electric lights I mean tonight we  have the Stars we have the moon and we  have the tower kill four thousand tiles  they&amp;#39;re just about to block this up a  foot and they&amp;#39;re gonna seal it in it&amp;#39;s a  lot of hard work at coalface because  this is industry could you imagine what  it must have been like to see a castle  being built of stone surrounded by these  kills that the firing flames into that  much die let&amp;#39;s set back here thinking  about that&amp;#39;s the hell down there and the  heavens up there and your tiles  currently in purgatory which way they&amp;#39;re  gonna go have you been good will they be  using that blossom  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  it takes several days for the kiln to  cool down Peters helping to unload the  tiles and examine the results  oh yeah oh yeah this is really like this  sound is perfect like for us that  ringing sound is what you&amp;#39;re looking for  what why are you guys twitching on the  tiles Oh to see to see if he&amp;#39;s cooked  because sometimes the sound is not  enough  anyway the song can be a meter we don&amp;#39;t  have slow-cooked so we can spit on it  and if the side of a stay there it&amp;#39;s  cooked if it&amp;#39;s going inside inside it  it&amp;#39;s not every single trial coming out  of this kiln view of quality rolling  them you&amp;#39;re listening to yes you&amp;#39;re  unsure especially it goes yeah we can&amp;#39;t  fit on every 1000 oh we have an example  so it was not for this 5m it was for one  before when overcooks was going like  that so we have this bubble of gas  inside and the bubble is big is going  bigger and decide which bursts with time  this is good plenty handmade well I saw  how hard you guys worked and how long it  takes to make these tiles - I&amp;#39;m happy  especially with this timing with really  happy yes we have very good results very  nice to have it  the fire tiles are now used to floor the  fully rendered and lime washed quarry  Tower  it will take thousands more tiles and  several more years of rendering lime  washing and painting before the entire  castle finally looks like it might have  done in the 13th century with the tiles  and the walls or plastered and painted  it&amp;#39;s starting to get that feel of a  living space I&amp;#39;ll be honest I did not  appreciate how much work and effort it  would take to get this stage actually  happening you know clave the tiles  finding the paint but when you see it  it&amp;#39;s unbelievable and I really can&amp;#39;t  wait I know it&amp;#39;s a long time in the  future yet but for the furniture and the  furnishings for the textiles to finally  arrive  wherever size is there&amp;#39;s actually a  living space and not just a defensive  building doesn&amp;#39;t it in moments like this  you look unless you know yes I&amp;#39;ve  actually sit here and relax yeah it&amp;#39;s  not all about warfare when it comes to  curses this is an entertaining space  next to the Great Hall you can bring  your more select guests in here to wine  them and dine them and perhaps a guest  bed in here and everybody else sleeping  rounds or mats you can get the feel for  that sort of convivial way of life I  have to say though the medieval period  far more colorful and I thought it was  next time the community of skills it  takes to build a castle from the  blacksmith transforming metal  to the neverending need for wood plus  making a medieval water mill Wow is all  I

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="4.86">alright guys so this is the second level  10 puzzle that&amp;#39;ll ever try and attempt  this is known as the Washington Monument  puzzle it is a wooden puzzle the object  of this puzzle is to remove the obelisk  from the base and then replace it and  that&amp;#39;s all I know I don&amp;#39;t know if any of  the parts have anything to do with  anything and it&amp;#39;s gonna be a bit of a  challenge so I&amp;#39;ve literally taken the  day to shoot this hopefully doesn&amp;#39;t take  too long as I want this to be up today  which is Saturday it&amp;#39;s not gonna be an  easy task also guys if you haven&amp;#39;t  checked out my last video I performed  some magic in the Bahamas last week  which is which explains the the tan the  fair skin do you guys want to check that  out I&amp;#39;ll leave the link below or you  guys can go ahead and watch that before  we get into this go ahead and like this  video if you enjoyed this content it  always helps subscribe to new here and  without further ado let&amp;#39;s try to solve  this Washington Monument possible all  right so here we go let&amp;#39;s take this  apart this is how I&amp;#39;ve received this  puzzle the Washington Monument  there&amp;#39;s a red white and blue on the  flags there&amp;#39;s the number white monument  on a red base can you find the other  blue I have no idea what that means the  object of the puzzle is to unlock and  open to find the blue and red lock it  you&amp;#39;ll have you&amp;#39;ll have solved the  puzzle when you can complete these two  stages first stage lock all the gravity  pins inside the round base of the  obelisk so they do not move mmm this  will allow you to remove the obelisk  from the base if you open the puzzle by  chance  gravity pins will still move freely this  is not the intended solution the first  stage is not completed until the gravity  pins are locked inside the round base  all tools are given with the puzzle and  let&amp;#39;s try it out so these things  okay there&amp;#39;s something in here so these  these pins have to lock in here without  moving  gravity pins why would they be called  gravity pennies as you can hear there&amp;#39;s  some type of mechanism on the inside of  this and I guess these things have to  lock using that mechanism let&amp;#39;s try it  one at a time  it&amp;#39;s slowly rotating the base to see  what that locking mechanism comes in  handy  so I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m so let&amp;#39;s put all  the flags in and then try and lock it or  do one at a time and if it&amp;#39;s one at a  time I&amp;#39;m not sure which one is supposed  to lock first so the first part is  trying to figure out now I&amp;#39;m trying to  see if the height of all these  individual flags are the same or if  there&amp;#39;s one that drops down a little bit  lower so for now it kind of looks like  they&amp;#39;re all the same height so this one  seems to be locked give it the old  spinner route  hmm and this one seems to be it moves  but it&amp;#39;s super tight there in this one a  little bit tighter  okay some reason this just turned me  because I&amp;#39;ve walked one of them  so I&amp;#39;m moving that inner mechanism and  it seems like it&amp;#39;s allowing me to move  the obelisk it&amp;#39;s coming out of it so  it&amp;#39;s coming out just a little bit feel  like I&amp;#39;ve unlocked like one part Oh God  be the spin of something  oh okay so as you can see we&amp;#39;ve  discovered that the pin here can be  removed now what does that do I have no  idea  no seem to do anything but I do believe  that it&amp;#39;s supposed to come out hmm okay  so we got an extra piece here to play  with it&amp;#39;s interesting but feeling this  whole thing relies on gravity somehow so  there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a pin there&amp;#39;s a ball  in here  and it feels like it&amp;#39;s at the top here  we got to make a travel to the bottom  somehow  oh I think I found something here listen  to this I think the pin here is actually  a magnetic pin because when they tilted  it and put the pin in there was a ball  and it stopped moving so listen you hear  that watch listen so you hear the ball  drop there&amp;#39;s a ball here my guess this  is just a guess but the ball has to  travel all the way down into the base  now I don&amp;#39;t know what the inner  mechanics of this obelisk look like but  I think I think it has to travel down  there some house maybe it&amp;#39;ll swirl it  coupe got hot yeah cuca it seemed to be  gravity pins on the inside of this much  like the puzzle where you had to rotate  see I know there&amp;#39;s gravity pins down  here and there seems to be a ball  bearing in here and that so far we&amp;#39;ve  established see if that ball is moved at  all  [Music]  oh I think I&amp;#39;m close I think I&amp;#39;m close  whew look at that  that is interesting  Wow why are they sticking what is that  oh wow all right this is probably one of  the most interesting mechanisms I&amp;#39;ve  ever seen if I&amp;#39;m right this is how this  works  there&amp;#39;s a tube here like a glass or  plastic tube and the tube runs all the  way down this obelisk these pins are  attracted to magnets as I see and if I  go like this watch this watch boom so  there&amp;#39;s a magnet in here my guess is  that magnet is in the shape of a ball  bearing and in this tube you see what  that is that&amp;#39;s like sand or some type of  like sandy yeah it&amp;#39;s in and there&amp;#39;s a  ball bearing and the ball bearing  happened to be at the top of this tube  attached to this magnetic pin and so  this magnetic pin would hold that ball  bearing up here and the sand prevented  the ball bearing from reaching the base  of this here so by shaking it it slowly  by taking twenty minutes to shake this  thing it slowly moved its way down to  here and then as I was I noticed as I  was shaking this thing here all of a  sudden there was less and less clicks  and so I started figuring out that yeah  okay these pins somehow are getting  caught by the magnet and there it is  this puzzle it says here has a second  stage is unlocked the gravity pin so  they flow freely once again this allows  you to lock the obelisk back in the  square so the first stage is done now  that the gravity pins are all locked not  sure  here seems to be something in the base  of this I don&amp;#39;t understand why there is  there&amp;#39;s like a little rubber seal in the  base of here  there&amp;#39;s red white and blue on the flags  there&amp;#39;s a white monument on a red base  can you find the other blue ok so  there&amp;#39;s got to be something blue in here  so the object is to unlock open and find  the blue close and relock it you&amp;#39;ll have  solved the puzzle when you can complete  these two stages so what I mistook I  mistook these for the gravity pins these  were clearly just a decoy just a  diversion but it says find the blue and  I&amp;#39;m not gonna close it all up right now  because there seems to be something  missing in here ok that&amp;#39;s just a space  for the gravity pins to flow around in  in here however does this thing move hmm  oh so this little plastic seal seems to  be coming out  okay just seems to be a piece of a pipe  I have no idea what this is for does  this does this piece come out why is  that in there is that is that the blue  they&amp;#39;re referring to is black oh that&amp;#39;s  it I think that&amp;#39;s the blue they were  referring to is the blue stripes on this  so you got the red which is the base the  white which is the obelisk and the blue  which is these little blue stripes I  find this part to be a little bit  nonsensical to be honest because this  clearly is just a piece of PVC piping it  even has like a little code on it which  makes it really cheap looking I think  they could have added something more for  that blue maybe you know paint this  whole entire thing blue that would have  been a lot clearer there you have it and  that goes back in there because this is  unlocked we got to lock it again that&amp;#39;s  the final part of this puzzle so once  again trust the sand I would say because  I started so the pins still seem to be  magnetized maybe by shaking real hard  they&amp;#39;ll come apart but if I let them go  they&amp;#39;ll stick right back to that bearing  letting me know that the bearing is  still the base I&amp;#39;m gonna have it travel  to the top somehow by the way this is  not the solution this is just telling me  what I&amp;#39;m supposed to do  so basically tells me you have to find  the blue Bobo blah this is not a  solution okay so the ball bearings here  that&amp;#39;s how I know the ball bearings on  the top is that this pin isn&amp;#39;t staying  there it was clearly not working  [Music]  the problem here is that that ball  bearing is attracted to these pins and I  can&amp;#39;t have the ball bearing travel to  the top because all the pins are holding  it there and if I shake it the pins go  back to attracting the ball bearing I&amp;#39;m  not sure exactly how I&amp;#39;m supposed to get  the ball bearing travel back up oh okay  this might be a crazy idea but you see  this ring here check this out haha  there&amp;#39;s a reason this ring was in the  air and I just you know that you get  that moment that you reach a moment this  is why this ring was here  bam bam now to test  still no  [Music]  it&amp;#39;s interesting because I feel like if  I shake it downwards the ball bearing is  gonna move up so I feel like I have to  shake it upwards for the ball bearing to  move down it&amp;#39;s like a start here yeah I  mean oh oh oh listen to this  this my friend is the sound of success  the ball is now attracted to the metal  ride so if I lift the metal rod you will  hear the sound of the ball dropping down  listen there it is this is interesting  too because like those twisty puzzles  like the ones that rely on gravity pins  normally we&amp;#39;re you know solving puzzles  resis intrical force where if you spin  it it&amp;#39;ll unlock it in this case if you  spin it it locks it from from being able  to get out so that&amp;#39;s really interesting  put that back and again we can set up  the little American flags and an aunt an  aunt an aunt an aunt that is the  Washington Monument level 10 puzzle  solved very challenging as well took me  up and about one and a half hours solve  this little bad boy alright guys that  was it we didn&amp;#39;t we solve this puzzle  which is super cool really really  impressed with this more impressed than  with the locked puzzle the locked puzzle  I&amp;#39;d seemed to be random bits and parts  that you had to shove around and sort of  shim around to end up opening the lock  this however did require some logic I  had to really use my ear wasn&amp;#39;t so much  tactile as it was just sensing you know  what the mechanics were on the inside  and and having a base knowledge of  puzzle solving including the magnetic  pins including the ball bearing the sand  was something new that I&amp;#39;ve never that  I&amp;#39;ve never thought of before and it was  really cool to be able to use that  plastic PVC ring to stop those pins I  thought that was a really genius way of  putting that together so all in all a  really difficult puzzle I hope you guys  enjoyed that if you did again like this  video subscribe to new here and we&amp;#39;ll  see you on the next video  [Music]  [Applause]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.97" dur="5.59">[Music]  I&amp;#39;m Peter Campbell from web Wagon Pizza  Company it&amp;#39;s Pizza Week in AZ cooks  kitchen everyone&amp;#39;s got their own teeth  on a calzone but the calzone a comes  from the 18th century  traditionally back then and Italy pizzas  were fork-and-knife foods that you would  eat in a dining room they were wet in  the middle and they were hard to travel  with so the cows army was born the  calzone was meant to be a mobile pizza a  birdie told me that somebody here that  I&amp;#39;m using his kitchen his fan of  calzones with ricotta sausage and  mushrooms so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re gonna  make now you can use a pretty hefty  amount of sauce because you&amp;#39;re creating  this pocket where it&amp;#39;s not gonna be able  to leave gonna grab some mushrooms that  we roast out of the wood-fired oven at  red wagon a little bit of sausage then  our house-made ricotta from red wagon  right here that I brought with me  because it&amp;#39;s not a calzone in my opinion  unless it&amp;#39;s got a little bit of just  standard cheese now the grated cheese we  use is half provolone half mozzarella so  got a calzone II looks like a half-built  pizza 100% correct  we&amp;#39;re gonna close the door though so  we&amp;#39;re gonna put a little bit of water  you can use egg wash I like using just a  little bit of water around the edge  we&amp;#39;re gonna take this fold it over now  there&amp;#39;s a number of different techniques  I like to push through completely to  make sure that nothing&amp;#39;s coming out then  if it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s pushing I  might even fold it over a little bit so  last thing we want cuz it cows on that  explodes inside the oven  certainly the guy who cleans the oven  doesn&amp;#39;t want that right now might take a  little bit of olive oil and then just  right over the top  if that seems so it gets a nice  golden-brown edge to it  we&amp;#39;re gonna make a very minor cut so it  doesn&amp;#39;t explode all right  calzone don&amp;#39;t explode  [Music]  so we pulled it out of the oven it look  golden brown we put a little olive oil  on top oh look at that  I mean that is stunning I Got News for  you this smells looks and I know it&amp;#39;s  gonna taste absolutely fabulous  Oh mm-hmm this is just ridiculously  ridiculously good and you can taste that  last little brush of olive oil on top  the mushrooms are amazing the tomato and  cheese balance is crazy good and now you  know how to make pizza dough make pizzas  do calzone pizzas several different ways  because when I don&amp;#39;t know how to do  something right because I believe in  culinary literacy I also believe in  picking up the phone and calling friends  you know a lot more than I do so thank  you you&amp;#39;re very welcome  [Music]</text><text start="5.18" dur="6.28"></text><text start="7.56" dur="6.36"></text><text

dur="3.63">thank you very much for the suggestion it</text><text start="19.78" dur="2.7">taught you how to make the earrings for this</text><text start="21.28" dur="3.39">sweetie but you can also</text><text start="22.48" dur="3.809">just make the figure that is by taking it out of</text><text start="24.67" dur="4.14">the part  from the center I tell them</text><text start="26.289" dur="6.051">how to do it and without anything else to say</text><text start="28.81" dur="3.53">we start with the tutorial</text><text start="43.67" dur="3.959">we start by taking a 15</text><text start="45.649" dur="4.14">centimeter candle and we talk it in the middle and</text><text start="47.629" dur="5.581">there where it bends we place two</text><text start="49.789" dur="5.25">20 centimeter strands on one side and 2 others of</text><text start="53.21" dur="3.599">20 centimeters to the other side and</text><text start="55.039" dur="4.261">we place it on the table with a clamp, leaving</text><text start="56.809" dur="5.16">a little space above, then</text><text start="59.3" dur="4.559">we are going to take one of the 12 o&amp;#39;clock 20</text><text start="61.969" dur="3.751">centimeters on the left,</text><text start="63.859" dur="4.05">we pass the one on the left over it  a on</text><text start="65.72" dur="4.17">the right and we make a new half</text><text start="67.909" dur="4.561">new cord to the left and a half</text><text start="69.89" dur="4.5">cord knot to the right and then</text><text start="72.47" dur="3.959">we make a new half cord to the</text><text start="74.39" dur="5">left again and a half new</text><text start="76.429" dur="2.961">cord to the right</text><text start="83.51" dur="4.8">then we are going to take the 12 20</text><text start="85.64" dur="4.26">centimeter candles  on the right side and we pass</text><text start="88.31" dur="3.57">the truth on the right over the one on the</text><text start="89.9" dur="4.17">left and make half a new bead</text><text start="91.88" dur="3.84">to the right and half a new bead</text><text start="94.07" dur="3.78">to the left and we repeat</text><text start="95.72" dur="4.32">again half a new bead to the</text><text start="97.85" dur="4.28">right and half a new bead to the</text><text start="100.04" dur="2.09">left</text><text start="107.87" dur="5.43">with the threads  on which they made</text><text start="110.3" dur="5.25">the knots we are going to make a flat or</text><text start="113.3" dur="3.93">square knot as you say and from</text><text start="115.55" dur="3.48">this way and we are simply going to make</text><text start="117.23" dur="3.6">one making all the threads in the</text><text start="119.03" dur="4.56">middle or in our center and they do</text><text start="120.83" dur="5.94">not move if they do not want to do the  I</text><text start="123.59" dur="5.13">recommend not placing the</text><text start="126.77" dur="4.76">folded 15 centimeter strand at the beginning, it is the</text><text start="128.72" dur="2.81">only thing that changes</text><text start="132.819" dur="4.17">after this, we are going to remove our</text><text start="134.499" dur="4.561">fabric from the table with tweezers  and we are going to</text><text start="136.989" dur="4.08">adjust the part of the little loop of the</text><text start="139.06" dur="4.319">ring well, in this case I already told you a little</text><text start="141.069" dur="3.331">shorter and that is done by pulling the middle strand</text><text start="143.379" dur="2.401"></text><text start="144.4" dur="3.27">the two middle strands that we placed</text><text start="145.78" dur="4.739">at the beginning then I recommend</text><text start="147.67" dur="5.31">cutting the small excess on</text><text start="150.519" dur="5.071">top and  burn them because later it</text><text start="152.98" dur="4.83">becomes more complicated</text><text start="155.59" dur="4.229">in this part, be careful to pull the</text><text start="157.81" dur="4.429">loop of the ring to one side so as not to</text><text start="159.819" dur="2.42">burn it.</text><text start="162.8" dur="3.81">We reposition our fabric from the</text><text start="164.57" dur="4.92">table with a clamp and we are going to add a</text><text start="166.61" dur="4.62">20-centimeter strand that will be a</text><text start="169.49" dur="3.87">new plane  or square on all the</text><text start="171.23" dur="3.65">threads that we have and it is only a</text><text start="173.36" dur="3.8">new one</text><text start="174.88" dur="4.56">so that the threads remain symmetrical I</text><text start="177.16" dur="4.17">recommend you to make the knot loose and not</text><text start="179.44" dur="4.38">tighten until the ends join and then</text><text start="181.33" dur="6.2">pull and tighten well and then</text><text start="183.82" dur="3.71">continue tying the knot because only one</text><text start="194.38" dur="4.14">if you added the  thread from the beginning to</text><text start="196.48" dur="3.84">do it with a ring I recommend that in this</text><text start="198.52" dur="4.95">part you take them, which are the shortest threads,</text><text start="200.32" dur="5.67">it shows and you cut them almost to the</text><text start="203.47" dur="3.93">trace where we have the te  jido and then</text><text start="205.99" dur="3.63">you reposition the entire board with</text><text start="207.4" dur="4.05">pieces because in the third thread</text><text start="209.62" dur="4.53">reading from left to right you are going to</text><text start="211.45" dur="4.41">add a 20 centimeter thread and</text><text start="214.15" dur="3.87">with it you are going to make a new</text><text start="215.86" dur="5.58">cord here I am making it loose</text><text start="218.02" dur="5.88">without affirming it but you can  affirm the</text><text start="221.44" dur="5.13">same thread on the table with the piece and I</text><text start="223.9" dur="4.83">recommend you make the new one super loose and</text><text start="226.57" dur="4.44">then join the ends so that it is</text><text start="228.73" dur="3.92">more symmetrical and then tighten the</text><text start="231.01" dur="7.74">world</text><text start="232.65" dur="7.51">[Music] well</text><text start="238.75" dur="3.51">with one of the threads that</text><text start="240.16" dur="3.57">we added that is more to the right</text><text start="242.26" dur="3.6">we make a cord

start="252.43" dur="4.2">we take another 20 centimeter era and</text><text start="254.65" dur="3.899">do exactly the same as I</text><text start="256.63" dur="3.359">tell you the new cord here I did it in the</text><text start="258.549" dur="3.541">air without affirming it but you</text><text start="259.989" dur="4.081">can perfectly affirm it  I</text><text start="262.09" dur="3.54">recommend leaving them loose and then</text><text start="264.07" dur="3.87">joining the ends so that they are</text><text start="265.63" dur="4.68">symmetrical. Do not forget to</text><text start="267.94" dur="5.14">tighten the knot later, make the other one, which is in</text><text start="270.31" dur="4.81">the next one,</text><text start="273.08"

doesn&amp;#39;t come loose so much and you</text><text start="293.08" dur="4.08">can also do that after adding</text><text start="295.15" dur="4.56">another strand in the same</text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.89" dur="4.89">okay so in this video I&amp;#39;m going to show  you the shoes you cannot put height  insoles in again based on my last videos  I was explaining those were shoes you  could and these are shoes you cannot and  the reason you cannot is simply because  of the amount of room that the shoe  allows you to have the actual shoe lift  or hide insole it is about two inches so  you have to realize you need at least  two inches of give or an inch and a half  of give bika because of the compression  so I do recommend ankle height or higher  and now I&amp;#39;m going to show you the shoes  you can&amp;#39;t put them in first shoe guys  this is the runner so I love this shoe I  think this is the Nike Free Run  thank you for your unfor point oh I&amp;#39;ve  tried so when I first started wearing  hight insoles I actually tried wearing  with this I&amp;#39;m not going into details  with the other ones but just so you can  see it&amp;#39;s not that that high-tensile  doesn&amp;#39;t fit it fits quite easily the  problem is is there&amp;#39;s not a lot of space  once you put your foot in so you could  wear them but they won&amp;#39;t be that  comfortable because they&amp;#39;re too tight to  the top so these sorry guys as much as I  love them I can&amp;#39;t wear them with them  and I don&amp;#39;t recommend you either your  foot will pop out and again you don&amp;#39;t  want that when you&amp;#39;re walking here&amp;#39;s a  second runner again it shows a little  bit more depth which is why I wanted to  show you a second type of runner simply  because this runner is a lot deeper so  the Asics runner has a lot more room  than the free the Nike Free Run but  still it&amp;#39;s definitely not enough so you  can see how it&amp;#39;s right there it&amp;#39;s just  not enough room to actually fit your  foot without slipping out so they fit  but I don&amp;#39;t recommend them they won&amp;#39;t  feel as good as with an ankle height or  higher shoe so second shoe I&amp;#39;m going to  say no to so these shoes guys I wanted  to show you more of a casual shoe which  you can&amp;#39;t wear them in these are just  converse regular low-cut and the reason  why you can&amp;#39;t wear them is simply  because they&amp;#39;re so low-cut they&amp;#39;re much  below the ankle now you might say oh  well the high-tensile does fit yes it  does fit but just like the runner it&amp;#39;s  extremely close to the top and there&amp;#39;s  no room so when wearing these guys your  foots going to slip  right out so these are a no-no they&amp;#39;re  nice to wear but unfortunately you can&amp;#39;t  get away with getting some extra height  out of them last but not least guys I  wanted to show you the difference of  what dress shoes you can put these in so  this is your standard dress shoe just a  standard dress shoe for men again the  height and sole does fit so I can&amp;#39;t say  it doesn&amp;#39;t because it does fit but  there&amp;#39;s not enough room for for me  personally to feel confident in wearing  these even if you tie them up tight  you&amp;#39;re just too close to the edge so as  much as I&amp;#39;d like to say give these a go  and you can try them out I don&amp;#39;t  recommend them just simply because  there&amp;#39;s not enough room if you check my  other video you&amp;#39;ll see the higher dress  shoe because there&amp;#39;s more room I do  recommend them and you&amp;#39;ll be able to  dance whatever you want in them at a  formal event with these maybe you can  wear them but you won&amp;#39;t get away with  much you might have to stand there and I  don&amp;#39;t recommend that so don&amp;#39;t do it guys  okay guys that concludes this video with  what shoes you cannot wear with hide  insoles if you have any questions or any  comments feel free to comment below  remember I&amp;#39;m still going to help you  grow</text><text start="3.889" dur="5.04"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="14.549" dur="5.23">hi Julia sure recipes for sweet life as  you may or may not know I have a  long-standing fetish with paper  postcards vintage note cards things of  that sort I&amp;#39;ve got a huge collection  some of which I&amp;#39;ve got here and I love  to use them throughout the year at the  holiday time and every season to dress  up my household decor so for instance I  have an old restaurant Stan to which you  tack on orders and I often clip the  postcards there and just swap them out  with this season but more often I like  to bring these special treats to people  more directly up close and personal by  putting them together in a special gift  so for instance today we&amp;#39;re gonna be  turning this particular postcard  into beautiful personalized place cards  that look like holiday gift cards if you  will so they&amp;#39;ll identify place settings  but they can also serve as a keepsake  that the guests can take home with them  after a holiday meal so let&amp;#39;s get  started ok let&amp;#39;s talk about what we&amp;#39;ll  need for this project first and foremost  you need a card that you&amp;#39;re gonna  repurpose I&amp;#39;m a bit of a Carta holic as  I said and I routinely scarer my antique  smalls for this sort of thing I love  this card because it&amp;#39;s classically  Christmas and has very little writing on  it so it&amp;#39;s gonna be perfect to scan for  my place card project you&amp;#39;ll also need  some colorful scrapbooking papers I love  these that come color-coordinated and in  seasonal themes and I&amp;#39;ve got sources in  my video description for them you&amp;#39;ll  need a paper cutter and you&amp;#39;ll need a  few crafting tools to put eyelets in the  corner of the tag to secure two pieces  of paper together this little kit and  that got the source in the video  description as well includes all those  tools and more it&amp;#39;s got a crimping tool  this metal tool for putting the eyelets  in place and I&amp;#39;ve chosen red eyelets for  the holiday season it&amp;#39;s also got a paper  punch a little pink pad so when you&amp;#39;re  hammering the eyelet you don&amp;#39;t damage  your countertop and last but not least  you&amp;#39;ll need some ribbon for tying the  tag together if you want to up your game  and do an edible place card hop on over  in my other video where I do a harvest  napkin ring made of cookies  the first step here is to get those  names on the card and of course you  don&amp;#39;t want to write directly on the  original piece because you&amp;#39;ll ruin it  and you won&amp;#39;t be able to use it for  other projects so I&amp;#39;ve taken mine I&amp;#39;ve  scanned it using my Epson scanner but  any scanner will do and I have sized it  down a bit so that I can fit more to a  page and also I will be backing this  with additional scrapbooking paper so I  don&amp;#39;t want these to be too large  as far as font I superimposed it in  Photoshop but any photo editing software  will do and I used a traveling  typewriter font quirky kind of  typewriter set which just fits my  country vintage theme  pretty heavy cardstock it&amp;#39;s printed on  and it&amp;#39;ll be even more sturdy because  I&amp;#39;m gonna back it with colorful paper as  you&amp;#39;ll see in the next step for this  process I like to use spray adhesive  because it goes down very very smoothly  without any lumpiness as opposed to  other types of glue process is extremely  simple simply spray the adhesive on the  back of the paper and stick the prepared  gift card sheet on top I like to cover  my surface with parchment paper and also  put up a backdrop this is spray adhesive  contend to go everywhere now come to  think of it I probably should have  sprayed the gift tag paper and not the  larger piece because I&amp;#39;m gonna trim off  that excess and it&amp;#39;s gonna be all sticky  and I&amp;#39;ll have a hard time reusing it but  live and learn we&amp;#39;ll do that next time  I&amp;#39;m gonna do the same thing with two  pieces of scrapbooking paper I&amp;#39;m gonna  put those back-to-back they&amp;#39;ll form a  back page if you will because I&amp;#39;m gonna  double up this tag it&amp;#39;s gonna have two  pieces of paper to it hinge together  with the eyelet just like so but before  we do that we need to trim these down to  size I&amp;#39;m just gonna use my handy dandy  desktop size paper cutter for that which  I just love as I can do this kind of  work anywhere and I&amp;#39;m going to trim up  the backing piece the doubled-up  scrapbooking paper so it&amp;#39;s just about a  quarter of an inch bigger all the way  around  okay the next step is to put the eyelet  in place to secure those two pieces of  paper together and that&amp;#39;s as easy as  lining them up and punching a hole in  the corner the only thing to be aware of  is that the paper punch needs to  actually match your eyelet size if the  hole is too big the eyelet will swim  around and the paper will never be  secured tightly together but usually  these things are sized when you&amp;#39;re in  the craft store you can pick a punch and  eyelets that do fit together then put  that eyelet in face forward so the  pretty side is facing up turn it over  onto your mats you don&amp;#39;t damage your  counter place your crimping tool in the  back of the eyelet and again the island  needs to be sized to fit that crimping  tool and vice versa if it isn&amp;#39;t when you  bang it in place you&amp;#39;ll either destroy  the eyelet or the two pieces won&amp;#39;t be  secured tightly together but this one is  perfectly sized and the test here as  you&amp;#39;ll see is that they&amp;#39;re nicely  secured there&amp;#39;s a nice tight fit here  now my last step is to string it on up  with ribbon and I&amp;#39;ve chosen that  color-coordinated red and a ribbon with  a little bit of stitching on the edge  which I think ties in really nicely with  my country Christmas theme I&amp;#39;m just  going to do a very very simple bow  nothing to it and the finishing touch is  trimming up the edges and sticking in a  little bit of beautiful evergreen cut  from my trees in my yard now when I&amp;#39;m  setting table settings for the holiday  season I like to use a layered approach  again drawing on mismatched China and  lots of different patterns but to keep  it harmonious I make sure that color  palette is tight it&amp;#39;s very red and green  as you can see in very very festive with  the place card sit on top  now I&amp;#39;ve got a number of other  repurposing ideas that all use the same  concept and they&amp;#39;re all great for the  holiday season the first uses the same  card in a slightly different way in here  have printed menu items on it the idea  here is to stick this little tag next to  the item on a buffet table or at a  cookie swap to identify what it is  guests are eating you put the printed  papers on the back but you might also  consider printing the ingredients there  with all the allergies people have these  days this is often a good idea here&amp;#39;s a  graphic that I really really love but it  posed a problem because of all the text  so I simply whited that out in Photoshop  and expanded the pane so that I could  put a menu there instead here&amp;#39;s that  same graphic because I loved it so much  it became the title image here on a  multi-page invitation this is the little  pamphlet instead of the normal open card  that you open side to side and I think  that just creates a little element of  surprise  so each page has a little bit of  different information about the party on  it as you can see here I think this  third page has the what one and where  information yeah  and all of his cards are backed with  these gorgeous papers in different  patterns but I&amp;#39;ve maintained a really  tight color scheme so that the patterns  don&amp;#39;t start competing with one another  but instead harmonized in the last  little detail of I&amp;#39;ve used an eyelid  again but I&amp;#39;ve bound them with vintage  Christmas ornaments to tie into the  vintage theme here&amp;#39;s another beautiful  graphic and the same sort of pamphlet  idea but here instead I&amp;#39;ve printed  cookie recipes this was a little gift I  made for my friends that came to a  cookie swap I gathered their recipes in  advance and printed them out and they  were all given this little booklet to  take home so that they had everyone&amp;#39;s  recipes at the end of the day so pretty  simple right what a great way to extend  the beauty of something you really  cherish and love as simple as standing  it and translating it into a beautiful  little place tag until next time Lou  sweetly  you</text><text start="17.83" dur="3.709"></text><text start="19.779" dur="5.041"></text><text start="21.539" dur="5.111"></text><text start="24.82" dur="4.02"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="6.15">[Music]  I get an idea better about this house  and then inside here we actually have  you know a very very small house  obviously but we made it as efficiently  as we can with this home but also trying  to make sure there&amp;#39;s as much space as  possible we actually have a kitchen here  where the two burner stove and a kitchen  sink and then we also have our cabinet  space where you can actually put your  silverware  you know towels and everything else got  a garbage can and we got a couch here  that actually turns into a bed but we  are actually planning on building a  Murphy bed for this family so if we pull  it out into a queen-size bed but for the  show we actually displayed the couch  here and it really makes a really  beautiful look in here we also have a  refrigerator put up in the house so we  can actually be able to access it in and  how people be able to get inside so you  just open up the fridge and just get  whatever belongings you need then we  have a 42 inch TV we actually put in for  the show where we can mount it and I put  a little mount on the back of it so it  could tilt a little so you&amp;#39;re sitting  down on the couch you can actually watch  the TV easier instead having this flat  straight up against the wall we then  have a toilet which is a standard round  toilet and we put a sink on it so you  can actually wash your hands main assets  as far as the simple things for washing  hands brushing teeth for the simple  little sink here for where the handles I  can move around the stuff so you can  wash your hands there we also have our  standard 32 by 30 inch on a two inch  shower stall that we put in with a  showerhead up above so you can be able  to have it fall down like a waterfall  and because whenever we put the shower  head on against the wall it&amp;#39;s a little  bit harder for people to actually it&amp;#39;s a  little too low for them  so we made as high as possible up here  so we did very convenient I turn the  toilet this direction as well because if  we had it facing towards the living room  then the door is going to be the way we  got to make this as compact as possible  so we have a toilet base in the shower  so you can pretty much stretch your legs  out right in the shower but you still  have room to do all this so it&amp;#39;s very  incredible how you&amp;#39;re able to do this in  such a small space and make it work we  also have a little loft above the  bathroom where it&amp;#39;s a two foot locked  and no two feet going up to the ceiling  and we will be putting out a ladder up  there and with a railing for a little  girl to be sleeping up in there and then  here&amp;#39;s our other loft where we actually  have our AC unit we&amp;#39;re going to put our  water here in on Mondays in the mail  doesn&amp;#39;t why it&amp;#39;s coming so late but it&amp;#39;s  probably because of the holidays so that  will be coming in as well so here&amp;#39;s  another direction of the house and our  couch and the sink in the soap so we  made this work out pretty pretty nicely  for such a small space but I wanted to  add some few more things but I don&amp;#39;t  want to make it too cramped I really  want to make it a little bit more  spacious and I know for such a small  area to make this workout so anyway but  I&amp;#39;m very pleased for what we  accomplished here so if you guys have  any questions oh yeah and here&amp;#39;s one of  our floor mats says welcome friends to  our tiny home if you have you guys have  any questions regards to our house  please give me a call more than happy to  answer your questions that you may have  we have sold this for ten thousand  I&amp;#39;ll give you an idea about the pricing  of this home and just check out our  website and learn more about this house  and be more than happy to help you out  again thank you so much you have a  wonderful day  you</text><text start="0.5"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="3.869">hey guys welcome back today&amp;#39;s declutter  is gonna be on indie makeup brands and  instead of just racing through all the  products I like to share as much  information as possible with you guys so  we&amp;#39;re gonna be doing kind of an overview  of the products as we&amp;#39;re going through a  good thing about testing out products as  you guys know is sometimes you find real  winners and Holy Grail products that you  absolutely love the flip side to that is  not everything works out alright guys  here&amp;#39;s the indie brand products we&amp;#39;re  gonna be going over today I&amp;#39;ll go over  the brands first you know what we&amp;#39;ve got  here  this is love luxe beauty on this side  this is Vanessa&amp;#39;s vanity these are from  Etsy so I got Vanessa&amp;#39;s vanity and Labov  cosmetics that one is also from Etsy and  then addictive cosmetics from Etsy and  then this is Johnny concert we&amp;#39;re gonna  check out the Johnny concert eye shadows  first so I just watched these four here  go and swatch them on my arm and see how  those turn up you&amp;#39;ll notice right here I  have another set of swatches these are  actually from the Kat Von D Alchemist  the holographic alchemist palette these  are really similar in the swatches and I  don&amp;#39;t know if the sheen or the shine of  them is gonna come up on camera very  well they look a little more chalky on  camera right now but in person they do  have a really pretty Sheen both sets of  them so they&amp;#39;re definitely close enough  where you don&amp;#39;t need to have both of  these right so I am gonna go ahead and  set this aside though because I might  want to do a better comparison in the  future you know or pictures or swatches  for the blog or something with both of  those so well this one this one is not  in there running right now that&amp;#39;s  something I&amp;#39;m definitely keeping summers  gonna set that out of the way there and  this one I&amp;#39;m gonna hang on to for a  little bit longer and just kind of play  around with it spend some more time with  it  so I&amp;#39;m gonna keep the Johnny concert for  now okay we&amp;#39;re gonna go over a love luxe  Beauty next and they have a following on  Instagram they do a lot of swatches on  there so it makes it really fun to go on  there and see the products I&amp;#39;m gonna  start with her mermaid scales and this  is a product I did discover on their  Instagram page and thing with this was  it was kind of hard to tell exactly what  the product was gonna be like the  texture in formula is like a fluffy  whipped gel and it has glitter and  sparkle in it so we&amp;#39;re just gonna do a  little swatch there okay so the colors  that I have our daring it&amp;#39;s kind of a  pinky rose gold we have Valiant which is  an icy blue we have I think this is  Ellis let me double check yes it&amp;#39;s kind  of a lavender like  I&amp;#39;m kind of fluffy cotton candy lavender  and then we have gold which is intense  and then this one was their limited  edition one guess is supposed to be a  unicorn poo as far as I can understand  there yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t have a name it  just has a little picture on the front  so it&amp;#39;s just like a silvery base with  multicolored glitter so those are the  colors the thing with the formula though  is it doesn&amp;#39;t dry down it stays kind of  tacky and you&amp;#39;re only supposed to use a  tiny tiny bit so obviously I swatch  these a little bit heavier than I  probably should have but yeah just to  give you an idea it does not dry down it  does stay a little on the tacky side so  yeah that&amp;#39;s the only thing about these  is that they don&amp;#39;t dry down so for that  reason I&amp;#39;m gonna be letting go with  these but yeah if you&amp;#39;re into glitter  and you like to play with it then that  might be a fun option it just depends on  your personal preference oh you know  what let&amp;#39;s go and share this one right  now to these sparkle drops this is also  from love luxe beauty and let me just go  ahead and oh you know what maybe I  should shake that again I shook it just  before the start of the video but it  does seem to collect on the bottom quite  a bit the color is legit mermaid and  just do a little oops it&amp;#39;s a little bit  more watering than you might expect so  it feels just like a oil with glitter in  it and the glare is really pretty it&amp;#39;s  kind of an icy blue so the sparkle drops  also is a product that does not dry down  it stays fairly wet so again it&amp;#39;s  probably one that you would only want to  use a tiny bit and yeah it just stays a  little too slick and oily for me so that  one I&amp;#39;m gonna have to let go of all  right these are two large limited  edition compacts from love luxe beauty  and let me show you this one first this  is what mermaids are made of and it&amp;#39;s  got a teal it&amp;#39;s got gold like a really  pale gold in there Kayla do a little  swatch right there so you can see it&amp;#39;s  got that teal color to it it is really  pretty but it&amp;#39;s just not one that I  would probably be reaching for very  often this is what unicorns are made of  limited edition compact and like again  it does have a lot of blue in here they  are handmade so you never know exactly  what you&amp;#39;re gonna get or how much blue  you&amp;#39;re actually gonna have so check out  that blue okay so I&amp;#39;ll do a little  swatch there but I mean you can you can  see how strong that is right so  unfortunately neither of these work very  well for me due to the amount of blue  that are in both of these but if you&amp;#39;re  into doing fantasy makeup and you like  those mermaid  these would be a fun option so I&amp;#39;m gonna  go ahead and let go of those because I  can tell it&amp;#39;s just not gonna be  something I&amp;#39;m gonna get a whole lot of  use out of I&amp;#39;m not sure what the name is  on this product but I think it&amp;#39;s called  imaginary it&amp;#39;s just a pretty you know  kind of a peachy pink a little bit of  shimmer so this is a free gift with  purchase so I&amp;#39;ll stop there I&amp;#39;m not  going to be keeping that and then this  one oh yeah okay that that&amp;#39;s gonna need  to get repressed  I don&amp;#39;t even know if I want to mess with  that you know what okay I&amp;#39;m just gonna  set that aside for now the color is  called icing on the cake so the color is  kind of an icy shimmery pretty lavender  blue I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s gonna come  up looks a little more white on camera  right now but it is a really pretty  color too bad that it broke like that  yeah okay  we&amp;#39;re just gonna go ahead and close that  up and set that over there  okay for my glitter lovers out there  check this out this is a really pretty  product now what is the name of this I  cannot remember Oh unicorn wish so these  are loose glitter flakes and they&amp;#39;re  very light and fluffy so it&amp;#39;s not like a  heavy dense middle kind glitter  they&amp;#39;re almost like confetti so that&amp;#39;s  another really pretty one of you&amp;#39;re  gonna be doing fantasy makeup this is  also level X Beauty this is a miniature  what unicorns are made of or weight is a  miniature weight this actually might be  what they call large they had I remember  there was something weird on the website  where they were calling that size large  and then this size large they&amp;#39;d  accidentally sent me this large when I&amp;#39;d  ordered that one so I ended up with this  one anyway I&amp;#39;m not gonna take that out  of the package because it&amp;#39;s the same  exact product but okay let&amp;#39;s go and move  on to the bob cosmetics and this is a  little extra that they sent it&amp;#39;s just  you know like a little sample of glitter  so I&amp;#39;m going to set that over on outside  okay so here&amp;#39;s how they did their  packaging you can see the crystals on  the top some of these I did it kind of  press back down a little bit because  they&amp;#39;re kind of lifting up off the glue  so just so you&amp;#39;re aware of the packaging  let&amp;#39;s go ahead and check out the product  okay so we&amp;#39;ll do a little swatch here  and I got to be really delicate with  this because it does kind of flake up  just a little bit but hopefully you&amp;#39;ll  be able to see kind of how that looks so  when you just do like one swatch all the  way around and let me go ahead and  swatch that on my arm so you can see it  okay there is a little bit of chunkiness  oh wow look at that blue yeah that came  off  maybe I got in the blue too much  guys even guess what that would turn out  that blue by looking at that because it  has so much of the kind of like light  champagne and the pink and the purple  you wouldn&amp;#39;t even think that it would be  that blue you know it just to be fair  let&amp;#39;s go ahead and try to swatch around  the outer edge Cheers so let me try to  get some more that light light color  there and see how that comes out okay so  see that&amp;#39;s better not not as blue but it  does have quite a bit of silver tone to  it so it&amp;#39;s still very cool tone okay I&amp;#39;m  still gonna be leaving that on that side  now addictive Cosmetics I only got this  one product from them just to test out  and this is their rainbow highlighter so  this is a super pale rainbow it is so  pretty I wish I could get that to kind  of come up on camera a little bit better  for you guys but it&amp;#39;s a really really  pretty one but you can see it a little  bit of that rainbow right there so let&amp;#39;s  wait this my finger clean okay let&amp;#39;s go  ahead and swatch this try to get that  full rainbow to show up okay you can see  that now that&amp;#39;s a really pretty one it&amp;#39;s  very light very pale super soft I think  since the product is just so beautiful  that the packaging just needs to kind of  upgrade a little bit to match how  beautiful the product is but I really  like that one a lot so I&amp;#39;m gonna be  hanging onto that okay next up we have  Vanessa&amp;#39;s vanity and I got these on Etsy  and let&amp;#39;s go ahead and check this out I  always flip them over because I&amp;#39;m  looking for the name I forget that these  do not have any memes on them now this  one is not subtle at all right okay so  that&amp;#39;s got really bold rainbow colors I  was curious how this one was gonna be  okay so we&amp;#39;re just gonna swatch  back-to-back right there  so just comparing the two this rainbow  is a lot softer and more subtle and this  one is definitely more powerful it  definitely stands out it&amp;#39;s a lot more  bold so if you are into rainbow  highlighters and the fantasy makeup I  think this one is really really fun I  mean that is a gorgeous one this one I  believe is called unicorn toots this is  also from Vanessa&amp;#39;s vanity okay that  want to just throw all together and  we&amp;#39;ll do another swatch with that yeah  it&amp;#39;s just coming up a little more  silvery mauve I think with all the  colors mixed together so maybe you just  need to like hit certain areas okay  unicorn toots I did get a nice lavender  swatch out of it there but I am gonna  let go  one two I&amp;#39;ve got a couple samples from  Vanessa&amp;#39;s vanity - which actually I&amp;#39;m  just gonna set over here and then this  one is butterfly wings so let&amp;#39;s check  this one out  this is a loose powder or loose glitter  I should say so I think this is more of  a white base like a silvery white and  we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and swatch right there  okay so yeah it&amp;#39;s got that silvery white  base and a really tiny flecks of glitter  in it so it is pretty I decided that I&amp;#39;m  gonna be letting go of that though  because it&amp;#39;s just probably not gonna get  enough use for me here&amp;#39;s a liquid  highlighter this is invisible grape and  you do need to shake these up before  each use because they will separate okay  so let&amp;#39;s get up close here so you&amp;#39;ll  hopefully be able to see how pretty this  color is so it&amp;#39;s a really pretty  lavender highlight and it does dry it  out so it&amp;#39;s almost dry right now there&amp;#39;s  a slight bit of tackiness left to it  but yeah I do like that it dries down  I&amp;#39;m still gonna go ahead and pass this  on though because I do have some other  highlighters that I end up using more  often so I&amp;#39;ve only used this actually a  couple of times but that color is really  really pretty all right guys so on this  side this is what I&amp;#39;m keeping on this  side that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m letting go up on so  yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy that I got to try  these out  and that was the whole goal to test out  some new indie brands that I&amp;#39;ve never  used before you know to kind of check  out their quality see what they&amp;#39;re like  and so I got to do that so that was the  main goal there and just so you guys  know I am planning on making all of the  products I&amp;#39;m decluttering available to  anyone who wants them online so I&amp;#39;ll go  ahead and do some sort of sale blog sale  giveaway kind of thing I&amp;#39;ll figure it  out towards the end after you know after  I go through all of the products I&amp;#39;ll do  it all at once for you guys okay guys  I&amp;#39;m gonna move on to the next section of  makeup I&amp;#39;m gonna wrap up this video for  now though and I will see you in the  next one bye guys</text><text start="1.709" dur="3.84"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="6.98">hi everybody welcome to my channel I am  coral and you I can be making a giant  using chocolate chip cookie so bite  giant and oozing I mean I&amp;#39;m going to be  filling the inside of this cookie with  some kind of like chocolate spread it&amp;#39;s  not Nutella it&amp;#39;s some other kind of one  I found a shop it&amp;#39;s got like chocolate  and like white chocolate so this is my  first time actually making this giant  cookie so I haven&amp;#39;t tested it before so  you guys really come on this trip with  me to see how it turns out and I&amp;#39;m  hoping that it does turn out good  because then you can all try it and let  me know how it tasted for you  so for this giant using cookies you will  need 3/4 cup of sugar 3/4 cup of brown  sugar 300 grams of different chocolate  two and a half cups of flour 2 eggs 2  teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of  salt one teaspoon of vanilla extract 220  grams of butter and some chocolate  spread so the first step that you want  to do is to cream together our butter  our sugar and our brown sugar cream all  together with a hand mixer or a  standstill mixer until it&amp;#39;s nice and  fluffy  [Music]  so once we have our sugar and butter all  creamed together we&amp;#39;re going to add in  our eggs what a line one so first we&amp;#39;re  going to crack one egg I&amp;#39;m going to whiz  it in next we crack the egg with it  [Music]  so that&amp;#39;s one low and then the other  ball we&amp;#39;re gonna add all our dry  ingredients together and mix that around  and then we&amp;#39;re going to tip our dry  ingredients into our wet ingredients and  give those ones a mix so I&amp;#39;ll dry and  our wet and our friends best friends  mixing together in a whirlpool of fun  [Music]  with my chocolate bars I&amp;#39;m going to cut  them up into pieces so that they are  smaller  [Music]  I do not have a circle pan so I&amp;#39;m gonna  be using a rectangle pan to put my  cookie on today and I need to separate  it into two I&amp;#39;m gonna put my baking  sheet onto my baking tray press down  half of the mixture that I need to get  my delicious white chocolate hazelnut  spread and spread that on top leaving  edges at the side and then with the  other mixture I&amp;#39;m gonna roll that out  and put that on top and press the edges  down then I&amp;#39;m gonna put it into the  fridge and let it chill for 30 minutes  we need to start oven to 190 degrees  Celsius for any of these not asking  there&amp;#39;s a fancy people and we&amp;#39;re going  to put in our cookies a giant cookie  into the oven for 12 to 15 minutes and  we&amp;#39;ll see how it goes and maybe check it  to see if it is actually done because it  is two layers  fingers crossed let&amp;#39;s hope it all goes  well so it is the morning time I did  leave my cookie to cool overnight once  it&amp;#39;s in the oven because I got tired and  it was late so I went to bed because my  cookie was too hot to kind of break open  but obviously now it&amp;#39;s all nice and cool  and looks yummy so I&amp;#39;m gonna break into  and fingers crossed that it&amp;#39;s gonna like  ooze out or there&amp;#39;s gonna be something  there that&amp;#39;s chocolaty and that&amp;#39;s gonna  taste good and look good so let&amp;#39;s break  it open so I&amp;#39;ve broken it into half and  it didn&amp;#39;t lose out the way I wanted it  to but that&amp;#39;s probably cuz I left it to  cool overnight I&amp;#39;m going to take a bite  now and let you know how it tastes it  tastes like a cookie it tastes like a  cookie that is a good cookie the inside  is really like this one nice soft layer  and then the cookie itself is quite soft  and the edges a little bit more Brown so  they&amp;#39;ll be a little bit more crunchy but  it literally looks like a giant cookie  so if I grab the other half and put it  together it will just cover my face but  as the size of the cookie its giant and  it&amp;#39;s amazing  Thank You cookie for being so delicious  I hope you enjoyed watching this video  don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe to my channel  and try out this recipe let me know how  it went for you you can make them  smaller sizes if you want or a giant one  like I did I&amp;#39;ll see you in my next video  bye  [Music]</text><text start="2.639"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="8.57" dur="5.229">today we&amp;#39;re gonna make wild tile using  the Z tile forms we&amp;#39;re gonna make a  subway tile using our subway mold we&amp;#39;re  gonna make a pencil trim piece using the  pencil mold and last but not least we&amp;#39;re  gonna make a chair rail using our chair  rail mold we&amp;#39;re gonna show you a couple  different techniques of pouring to give  you ideas and what you can do we&amp;#39;re  going to start with 10 pounds of our  white countertop mix that has been pre  weighed a clean mixing bucket and some  clean water since this will be a highly  flowable mix we are going to start with  20 fluid ounces of water in the bucket  this will give us the same consistency  as the normal three quarts of water with  the full 50 pound bag slowly add in the  concrete as you&amp;#39;re mixing because of its  extreme high strength and flowable  properties we highly recommend using our  white countertop mix for cast and  concrete tile the reason we always start  with 10 pounds is so the concrete does  not begin to set in the bucket on a  larger scale pour you may want to mix  more at once but you will want to make  sure you have enough tile forms and  helping hands to distribute the concrete  quick enough coverages for the white  countertop mix in the tile forms are  listed on our website here you can see  the consistency similar to what we use  for cast and concrete countertops  however for tile forms we want something  more flowable from here we are slowly  adding water to taste remember a little  water goes a long way so a splash at a  time is all you need  [Music]  [Music]  this looks about right the consistency  you opted for it can vary depending on  your preference we find the more  flowable mix is slightly easier to  control and will level off better you  want to avoid over watering which could  lead to a separation in a weaker final  product as a rule of thumb do not make  your mix any wetter than what you see  here and you will be fine  carefully pour  concrete into the tile forms let it  slowly spread out and fill the form so  that the mix pushes all the air out this  will leave you with a smooth glossy  surface free of any trapped air or  pinholes when you demo all the tile  [Music]  between tile form trays you may notice  the concrete starting to settle and set  up in the pouring container if you  experience this it is a good idea to  transfer the contents from your poring  container back into the mixing bucket  and blend out of the concrete by hand to  redistribute the aggregate no more water  will need to be added at this time  they&amp;#39;re back to smooth flowable mix now  for the pencil tile again carefully pour  the concrete into the tile form trays it  is a good idea to start at one end and  slowly work to the other to allow the  concrete to push the air out of the mold  [Music]  if you overfill or under fill the molds  that&amp;#39;s okay you can always go back and  add more concrete or clean up any excess  that has overflowed before pouring the  chair rails we are again going to remix  the concrete to make sure we have a  smooth flowable mix filling the chair  rail mold to be done in the same fashion  as the pencil tile  for the last three we are only going to  fill the deepest bowl most portion of  the mold this will result in a large  pencil tile allowing us to create four  unique tile shapes from our three tile  molds  [Music]  here we are going to show you a  technique to create a slightly textured  tile we are using the Z release because  it will not affect the concrete spray a  moderate amount into the tile for mold  the trick here is to pour the concrete  into the mold while the release is still  wet has not had proper time to air dry  later when we deem all the tile you will  see the slight dimple texture which adds  unique design characteristic to the tile  don&amp;#39;t forget to top off your tiles if  you have some that are not quite full  now we will let these sit for 24 hours  until we are ready to demo them the next  technique we are going to show you is  one we call the two-tone dry pack we are  starting with roughly 1 tablespoon or 5  grams of charcoal pigment and 10 pounds  of concrete but you can use any color  and adjust the amounts to suit your  preference here we start with just 10  ounces of water because we want to make  a super dry mix you always want to blend  the water in your color before adding  the concrete slowly add in the concrete  while mixing  [Music]  you can see 10 ounces was not quite  enough but it is closer than you might  think we&amp;#39;re going to add some more water  one splash at a time until desired  consistency is achieved  [Music]  with that last splash the mix got too  wet  we&amp;#39;re looking for a crumbly mixture with  little to no flow to get there we&amp;#39;ll  broadcast some more concrete into the  mix  [Music]  still a bit wet so we add a little more  concrete there is no right around  consistency here but since we want to  intentionally create large voids in the  surface of the tile we want a super dry  mix that looks about right  notice how the concrete barely flows it  settles in the pocket this is the  crumbly consistency we are looking for  to place the concrete crumble off little  pieces into the tile floor mold the  smaller the pieces and the drier to mix  the more boards we should get  [Music]  here we use the margin trial to press  the concrete into the ball and make sure  it is flush with the top of the tile  floor mat ready we are going to repeat  these same steps into all three of our  tile floor molds  [Music]  [Applause]  now we are going to make a flowable  backer mix this time we are starting  with 10 grams of our charcoal keratin  pigment and 20 fluid ounces of water  adding twice the amount of pigment will  give us a slightly darker color that  will be visible on the surface of the  tile now we slowly add in 10 pounds of  light countertop mix and some additional  splashes of water until the desired  global consistency is achieved  [Music]  that should do it we will transfer the  concrete into our pouring container and  we are ready to go now we are going to  fill the remainder of the molds up with  our darker and more flowable backer mix  since there is already concrete in the  forums you may notice it is a bit harder  to control the concrete and you will  have a few more spills or spots you  cannot quite get concrete into not a  problem though we will use a margin  trowel to level off the concrete and  push it around to make sure all of the  walls are filled to the top this final  step is an optional one to help limit  the amount of cleanup that will be  needed later once the concrete has said  enough you can use a steel finishing  trowel to scrape away the excess  concrete on top of the molds make sure  you take caution not to dig into the  tiles  so it&amp;#39;s 24 hours after we poured the  tile and you&amp;#39;ll see how from the bottom  side what they look like they&amp;#39;re very  simple to take out when you are popping  them out you&amp;#39;re gonna wanna watch it on  to damage the form because they are  reusable you see when they pop out to  shine on them it actually looks like a  piece of glazed tile and you&amp;#39;re gonna  come out really easy just push up on the  bottom of the form keep in mind these  trays are reusable so you want to be  fairly gentle with them when you&amp;#39;re  taking them out when we pour these tiles  we sprayed reliefs in this tray and we  poured our contry right on top of the  wet release that&amp;#39;s gonna give you a  totally different look with the tile  when you pop them out you&amp;#39;re gonna see  it has there&amp;#39;s little pin holes in it  and it&amp;#39;s not as glossy so we&amp;#39;ll give you  a different type of tile when you grout  that the holes will fill up with your  grout and it&amp;#39;s a really interesting look  taking the pencil tiles out is a little  bit different I like to turn it upside  down kind of grab it and push from both  ends at the same time to loosen it up  every once in a while you will get up  overall good one but again you can see  how nice these pop I&amp;#39;ll perfectly glazed  taking the chair rails out is pretty  much the same as taking the pencil zone  and if you remember when we fill these  yesterday three the chair rails we  filled right to the top and three of  them we always filled up to the first  level what that&amp;#39;s gonna do is give us a  different size pencil so from this one  mold we&amp;#39;re actually created two separate  tiles  [Applause]  all right so here we have a pencil  created from the chair rail mall and  this is a pencil from our pencil mall  and you&amp;#39;ll see the difference in the  size and this is your standard chair  rail out of the form if you overfill  your forms you&amp;#39;re gonna see you&amp;#39;re gonna  get a little lip of concrete up here we  could simply just break off didn&amp;#39;t take  your gems haven&amp;#39;t sanded smooth all  these tiles were created using our white  countertop mix you can see the backside  is a little bit whiter than the front  right now because we just popped them  out of the balls these will continue to  whiten up probably for another 24 hours  however if you want them even whiter  than this you could use our white color  pack in our countertop mix it&amp;#39;ll even  create a whiter looking tile now we&amp;#39;re  gonna do mold dry pack tiles that we  made sometimes you have to be a little  more careful with these because they do  have all right sometimes they are a  little harder to come out if you  remember we use two different color  concrete&amp;#39;s in this and you can see the  lighter and then you could see the  darker mix the darker mix in here was  the liquidy concrete that we pour it  over the light mix that we pressed in  and you can see the pattern that it  creates it almost looks like a natural  stone again we&amp;#39;ll have to tip these off  and just sand these edges will be ball  of our pencils  popped out pretty easy again you&amp;#39;ll see  the look that we&amp;#39;re achieving here with  the dry mix keep in mind all these halls  are gonna fill in with when we grout it  so we&amp;#39;re actually gonna get a third  color it will be bald our chair rail  hopefully I have good luck taking these  out six for six not that these are  beautiful to clean our trays we use the  solution of three parts water to one  part neurotic acid spray it on the form  let it sit for a minute or two and then  put a chip brush works really nice to  just kind of wipe them gently that way  you&amp;#39;re not gonna scratch the inside of  the tray just loosens everything right  up and you want to make sure you rinse  them well before you reuse these  before installing the tile we want to  put a sealer on it we use our site aqua  14 just a little bit in container and  with a clean cloth would just wipe in  each tile with the Sai acryl usually one  or two coats is fine the reason why we  put the sealer on is so the grout  doesn&amp;#39;t stick on the tile later when  we&amp;#39;re grouting it you will notice when  the Sai ackles put on it&amp;#39;s a little bit  duller than it was so once this tile is  installed what we&amp;#39;ll do to get that  gloss back is to apply a coat of our  counter shine over the tile I have a few  sample boards that we made up to give  you some examples of what you could do  these tiles before we applied them we  coated them with our Seattle 14 to seal  them you can see that they took some of  the shine off so now to get that shine  back if you want to shine back we&amp;#39;re  gonna apply some toner shine just with a  clock all you have to do is wipe it on  go over the entire surface and it&amp;#39;ll  bring back that shine they&amp;#39;re gonna be a  lot classier simple as putting it on  like that wipe it on let it dry  now that the seat counter shine is dried  you could see what you get using our  white countertop mix with the Z counter  shine pretty much looks like a glazed  tile this is just one of the patterns we  came up with to give you some ideas you  can create your own patterns I mean  there&amp;#39;s many many patterns you could  come up with  here&amp;#39;s an example of our white  countertop mix we used the Z release in  the forms and applied the white mix into  the floor while the release was still  wet  this was the look you get you can see  all the little pin walls and you can see  what it looks like once they&amp;#39;re out here  we use our chair rail just the subway  tile these pieces here are pencils and  then we use the subway tile in a  vertical position  here&amp;#39;s the sample of our two-toned dry  pack you can see up here we use our  chair rail and then a pencil the subway  tile in a herringbone pattern another  chair rail a pencil and a vertical this  would be a great pattern for awhile we  have more surface to cover you&amp;#39;ll see  that we did not put our counter shine on  here we just seal this with the Seattle  14 we feel like is a more natural stone  effect which we were trying to create  here  here&amp;#39;s another sample of our dry pack on  this sample board we use the same color  for both the dry mix and the liquidy wet  mix the second color is created by the  grout because the grout is filling the  holes in the tile so again it&amp;#39;s another  option that you could do  this is another pattern we came up with  but what we did was we poured three  separate batches of concrete so you can  see we have basically three different  colors here we got that look by adding  different amounts of pigment to our  white mix created this look  Zion today was created using some  standard glass tile we cut strips off of  it and applied it inside of our tile you  can see the tiles here on the corners  were cut which could just be cut with a  standard wet saw is the easiest way to  cut these these tiles were also created  with our solution of erotic acid in  water we mix a solution of three parts  water and one part neurotic acid spray  it over two tile leave it on for about  30 seconds and rinse it off  totally d glosses the tile and you can  see it gives it a very very natural look  it looks like slate these are just a few  examples of what can be created using  our three tile forms I can&amp;#39;t wait to see  what creative designs our customers are  going to come up with  [Music]  you</text><text start="11.219" dur="7.98"></text><text start="13.799" dur="9.15"></text><text start="19.199" dur="7.021"></text><text start="22.949"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.64" dur="3.789">they already welcome to technical you  may recall a while back I made a video  about isopropyl alcohol i theorize that  you could use just plain old elbow  grease on a microfiber cloth to clean  the cpu contact surface and it would be  just as effective as using the cloth the  said elbow grease and isopropyl alcohol  and my testing did demonstrate that was  the case but I received two very valid  criticisms about the video that I plan  to address today first criticism  involved the type of paste I was using  when you reapply the same thermal paste  as the one you&amp;#39;ve previously used  obviously you&amp;#39;re going to get favorable  results because it&amp;#39;s not two chemical  compounds that are mixing unfavorably  together and number two the amount of  time between thermal pastry applications  was obviously just a few minutes on my  test bench and the average real-world  scenario is going to involve two three  or even five or longer years in between  thermal paste applications and of course  crusted on caked on disgusting old ass  thermal paste is going to be a lot  harder to clean off than something  that&amp;#39;s been freshly applied so will my  theory hold water stay tuned to find out  so here in front of me I have one of  three systems from circa 2006 it&amp;#39;s a pre  built and it hasn&amp;#39;t had a fresh thermal  paste application in over a decade so  testing is going to take place in three  steps step one I&amp;#39;m going to take the  motherboard out of the PC because I  don&amp;#39;t really need the rest of the  components for testing and I&amp;#39;m going to  leave everything else in place including  the RAM the heatsink and the old ass  crusted on thermal paste from 2006 and  I&amp;#39;m going to take a baseline temperature  reading for reference step two I&amp;#39;m going  to remove the heatsink rub off as much  of the thermal paste as I can with just  plain elbow grease and a microfiber  cloth and reapply thermal paste and take  a second reading I&amp;#39;m going to note the  temperature differential between the old  ass paste and the new paste without a  proper cleaning step three I&amp;#39;m going to  do the same thing I did in step two  except use isopropyl alcohol for test  three so what we&amp;#39;re hoping to see is a  difference in temperature but  step two and step three which will  validate the need for isopropyl alcohol  let&amp;#39;s go over my test bench and get  started okay ladies and gentlemen here  we are over at my workspace as you can  see it&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] mess but I&amp;#39;ve done my  best to try and organize in such a small  space so now what I&amp;#39;m going to do is  take off the hidden no I&amp;#39;m not going to  do that I&amp;#39;m just kidding  what I&amp;#39;m going to do I&amp;#39;m going to set  the camera down and I&amp;#39;m going to remove  the motherboard from the equation here  discard the rest and we&amp;#39;re going to boot  it up and see what we got okay ladies  and gentlemen there she is in all her  glory I&amp;#39;m just gonna give her a quick  squirt here oh god is gonna be bad oh  Lord  hello God disgusting  Oh alright so now what we&amp;#39;re going to do  is throw this [ __ ] cable out no one  gives a [ __ ] and we&amp;#39;re gonna hook this  up to my trusty ax 860 I&amp;#39;ve Corsair  yes Johnny I do use [ __ ] Corsair  power supplies okay I&amp;#39;m not a total  [ __ ] anti Corsair [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s  [ __ ] jail now I&amp;#39;m guessing for those  of you unaware that this is going to  because it&amp;#39;s so old not going to boot up  into 64-bit windows it might actually  but some I guess it&amp;#39;s got like a first  generation Athlon which means it does  not have the instruction set necessary  to perform six support excuse me 64-bit  Windows 10 so we&amp;#39;re going to have to  figure out something in the meantime  let&amp;#39;s put in my little ABCD stick right  here I&amp;#39;ll explain what that is at some  point it&amp;#39;s just a flash drive at QVC EB  on it which is a fantastic little tool  set that you can use to do all kinds of  nice [ __ ] and diagnostics and testing we  do have onboard video but you know what  I think it&amp;#39;d be better if I just stuck  with a DVI connection input card in so  I&amp;#39;ll do that and my test card here I  don&amp;#39;t know what this card is my current  I think it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an engineering  sample I picked up from one of my  friends up in North York PD AMD offices  Oh should I&amp;#39;ve said that maybe I  shouldn&amp;#39;t hey everything looks connected  let&amp;#39;s boot er up and see exactly what we  get and get all these  and screws off my goddamn [ __ ] okay  that&amp;#39;s loud huh whoa here we go we&amp;#39;re  posting we are posting took a while era  system fan has failed press f2 to  continue okay it&amp;#39;d probably be a good  idea if I connected a keyboard now where  is my USB dongle don&amp;#39;t motor when are  you dumb butter  ah yes okay so here we are at the ubcd  menu we&amp;#39;re going to just do a quick  memory test here because that will tell  us what cpu we&amp;#39;ve got are you ready  here&amp;#39;s the big reveal I&amp;#39;ll zoom in on  the perfect spot and I was right sorted  out uh so that&amp;#39;s on 64 x2 so it might  actually support Windows 10 64 bit let&amp;#39;s  see oh windows loading I believe this  SSD is installed with a legacy boot it&amp;#39;s  not UEFI so that shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem  the only problem is whether or not the  system has actually run Windows 10 64  bit hitting device is ready that&amp;#39;s a  good sign that&amp;#39;s a good sign  alright and we are home free look at  this no problems I anticipated being at  this [ __ ] all night as it turns out my  fears were unwarranted this is  incredible and just what does it  activated what does that happen take a  look here what do we got  temperature-wise we have this is often  misreported so I&amp;#39;m gonna no these are  good these are these are real  temperatures sometimes I don&amp;#39;t know if  you were aware of this or a lot of AMD  processors older ones in particular that  misreported their temperatures in window  is by like 20 degrees so it would show  up as like nine which obviously doesn&amp;#39;t  make any sense but these lightweight  real temperatures so cpu package is  being reported at 28 30 degrees at idle  and each of the cores is resting in  between 32 and 37 depending  when we look let&amp;#39;s just jump right into  prime95 and small FFTs to make it  virtually as hot as possible and there  we go we are started okay ladies and  gentlemen at several minutes later and  it looks like we&amp;#39;ve plateaued at a  average of 45 to 46 degrees on each of  the cores I think they&amp;#39;ve peaked at 47  45 respectively doing highest to lowest  and I think that gives us enough of a  idea of how these are going to pan out  for us to get our future readings I hope  anyway I was really hoping for higher  temperatures than this I was hoping for  it to get up into the 50s so I can have  more of a variance but this will have to  do okay so step 2 of this process  involves removing the heatsink and  taking a look at what&amp;#39;s under the hood  and giving it a good rubdown so let&amp;#39;s do  that now oh yeah oh so now we&amp;#39;re going  to set this down and I&amp;#39;m going to take  my microfiber cloth and just give it a  good thorough cleaning without any  isopropyl alcohol at all oh it&amp;#39;s like  rock-hard around the edges that&amp;#39;s  disgusting  oh okay all right let&amp;#39;s get to rubbin  trying to get it as stainless as  possible before I reapply thermal paste  but with a reasonable amount I&amp;#39;m not  going to sit here all day and do this  this that would be ridiculous  okay so all in all I think I&amp;#39;m happy  that&amp;#39;s the cleaned non alcohol surface  of the CPU and there is the surface of  the non alcohol cleans the heatsink so  now we&amp;#39;re going to pop this [ __ ] back  on with some fresh paste and take our  second reading for the test okay so here  we are we&amp;#39;re stressing it once again for  test number two I&amp;#39;ve applied cooler  masters icy fusion which is a pretty  run-of-the-mill standard not  particularly good not particularly bad  thermal paste and we&amp;#39;re looking to see  if we had any general improvement in  temperature from giving it a good rub  down without any alcohol and we&amp;#39;re going  to let it run for a few minutes again  until we get a nice stable Plateau and  come back and take an official reading  for the purpose of this video okay  ladies and gentlemen here we are after  the test and running for some amount of  minutes it&amp;#39;s not really all that  important all we look for is a plateau  where temperatures were not increasing  anymore and we found it because  temperatures once again stable exactly  where they were before  they&amp;#39;ve been stable at more or less this  for the entire duration so I think what  we can conclude at least for now is that  reapplying fresh kernel paste without  alcohol doesn&amp;#39;t net in any real  significant temperature gain but what  happens when we apply isopropyl alcohol  and give this thing I could clean well  that&amp;#39;d knock us down a few notches let&amp;#39;s  find out ok it turns out my my thermal  paste job wasn&amp;#39;t terrible  but it did obviously miss a little bit  of the edge is not really critically  important with AMD CPUs for the record  as long as you get a good spreading in  the middle you&amp;#39;re usually fine so let&amp;#39;s  clean this properly quote-unquote and  see if we can get an improvement in  temperatures ok so here we have our life  brand 99% isopropyl alcohol and we are  going to put some on the cloth like that  snip it a little better  Oh like I&amp;#39;ve never chloroform the person  before oh yeah it dissolves it so nice  doesn&amp;#39;t it  isopropyl alcohol you know I will say  this it might not necessarily get a  better difference but it does make  cleaning easier  alright I&amp;#39;ve gone off most of it now  let&amp;#39;s give it a couple of other scrubs  I hope the cameras getting all this  because I don&amp;#39;t want you to think I&amp;#39;m  cheating that looks pretty good I don&amp;#39;t  see much left on it the cloth looks a  little murky but pretty clean so let&amp;#39;s  do the cpu heatsink now and let&amp;#39;s give  the whole relevant surface area to  cleaning obviously the only it really  matters is the surface of the TV things  actually contacts the CPU all the stuff  around the edges here is not as  important  yeah didn&amp;#39;t a nice and deep yeah in it  deep let&amp;#39;s throw out some schmutz  let&amp;#39;s keep getting the schmutz off more  schmutz niche what&amp;#39;s off thing was  [ __ ] by a bunch of [ __ ] thermal  paste Cox and looks like it&amp;#39;s a lot of  here it&amp;#39;s still a little bit murky give  it another go  that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s like seven or eight passes  with this thing on 99% alcohol I can  almost see my face in that seems pretty  good so I think we&amp;#39;re good to go here we  got two perfectly clean isopropyl  alcohol surfaces let&amp;#39;s boot er back up  and see if we&amp;#39;ve gained anything  temperature-wise okay there&amp;#39;s my third  pee third PA okay Lisa gentleman&amp;#39;s time  to close off this portion of the video  once again there we have our two core  temperatures and there are the recorded  maximums right there in the middle of  the screen actually a little higher this  time but well within the margin of error  I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a real difference  here nothing to write home about oh and  for the record just one other thing I  wanted to note here the fan header that  I&amp;#39;m using to plug in this fan is  actually a three pin and you&amp;#39;re not  going to see this on the video but I  already checked the BIOS and the fan  speed variance is not particularly high  it&amp;#39;s been fixed at 2500 rpms through all  the tests  I just forgot to actually show you that  on the screen anyway so at the desk Jeff  and we&amp;#39;ll close it out okay so before I  begin let me address a couple criticisms  that I&amp;#39;m almost certain are coming my  way before I even finish this video  number one yes I&amp;#39;m fully aware that the  temperature variance between idle and  maximum temperatures was low and as a  result I&amp;#39;m not going to be able to see  very fine differences in results this  means that if you&amp;#39;re talking about  extreme overclocking i7 on custom liquid  cooling you might actually see an  observable difference between isopropyl  alcohol clean surfaces and plain-ass not  isopropyl alcohol clean surfaces but in  the majority of use scenario  as I just demonstrated when it comes to  stock cooling or even hyper 212 Evo want  a modestly overclocked i5 or i7 or  something like that go nuts if you have  a bad seating and you need to repay  still go out and buy a $9 bottle alcohol  to do it just [ __ ] take the goddamn  cooler off and do it secondly I know the  sample size was small I only had three  motherboards to test on I did use all  three I ran the test two additional  times and noticed no difference but I  didn&amp;#39;t bother filming it because the  video is already 12 minutes long so what  are you gonna do anyway I think we&amp;#39;re  gonna call that one a video streaming  streaming will happen this weekend I&amp;#39;m  gonna do it at least once a week now I  have convinced my girlfriend at the very  least to join me I have some friends or  maybe are interested in doing so as well  so stay tuned for that it will probably  take place on the YouTube channel right  here because apparently that&amp;#39;s the thing  you can do I was not really fully aware  of that until recently and I&amp;#39;d rather  than just not use another service I  better promote this channel and get  people here and lastly I just want to  say this is not a paid sponsorship at  all these people have not paid me I just  happened to eat lunch at this place  every day in Toronto called sky blue sky  cafe they&amp;#39;re really really great they&amp;#39;re  currently up for the best sandwich award  and Now magazine here in Toronto I&amp;#39;m  going to provide a link down in the  description if you have time just make  an accountant vote for them please for  me because they are like super super ass  nice and I just wanted to give them a  little 30-second spot and if you live in  Toronto or in the Toronto area and you  are able to go to one of their two  locations do it I&amp;#39;m telling you it&amp;#39;s an  amazing experience it&amp;#39;s like sex on a  button anyhow thanks for watching and  I&amp;#39;ll see you next time</text><text start="6.96" dur="4.53"></text><text start="8.429" dur="4.891"></text><text start="11.49" dur="3.54"></text><text start="13.32" dur="3.9"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="5.12" dur="6.76">hey everyone I&amp;#39;m back for anyone who  hasn&amp;#39;t seen my videos I&amp;#39;m G and I&amp;#39;d like  to thank everyone for their positive  response to my recent videos I recently  been asked some questions about the  elegance shear kitchen kirtan program we  often hear it  swags bell or calm so I felt what better  way to answer those questions not to do  a video Linda from Ohio s why are the  swags sold by the pears and the tiers  sold individually well Linda swags are  always sold in a pair the reason for  this is that you&amp;#39;ll always need a left  and right drop to frame the window  regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s a signal or  double hung window to create symmetry  you need even numbers of swags some  swags are attached in the center but  they still have a left and right drop  what I mean a left and right drop so a  swear swag pair you&amp;#39;ll always have one  to the left one to the right even if  it&amp;#39;s a double one hung window or a  triple hung window you&amp;#39;ll need one here  one there sometimes with the multitude  to the windows you had a swag here a  swag here a swag here swag here a swag  here a swag here whatever the  configuration of windows you&amp;#39;re always  going to need even numbers of swags  you&amp;#39;ll never use mod numbers you&amp;#39;ll  never use one 3 5 or 7 you&amp;#39;ll always  need 2 4 6 or 8 I hope that answers that  question  on to the next the elegance tier  curtains on the other hand are currently  the only tier curtains we sell  individually all other tiers we offer  are sold as a pair the benefits of the  elegant tiers being sold individually or  you can buy as many tier panels as  needed maybe you need 1 3 5 pounds to  complete your windows the elegance  sheers allows you to buy the exact  number of panels you need to complete  your project but even though they&amp;#39;re  sold individually  don&amp;#39;t be fooled there are 60 inches wide  most tears are sold as a pair there are  60 inches wide but they&amp;#39;re split in the  center so they are only 30 inches wide  on each side I have an example of what I  mean here the elegance here at 60 inches  wide is that big an example of the  simplicity which is sold like most other  tears is 30 inches wide  now this package would come with two  30-inch wide panels but they would be 10  12 15 20 dollars again the elegant sheer  is sold individually the 24 inch tear  panels are sold at $4.99 and they&amp;#39;re 60  inches wide I would consider that a  value my next question is by Molly from  Virginia she asks I installed my curtain  rod 24 inches above the sill of the  window and the 24 inch tear curbs I  purchased are about 2 inches above the  sill plate shouldn&amp;#39;t they be touching  the sill please help  good question Molly curtains are always  measured from the top of the header to  the bottom of the curb regardless of  whether it&amp;#39;s a tear swag or bounce top  of the header bottom of the Curt top of  the head or bottom of the curb top of  the header bottom of the curb  so if you install 24-inch tears and you  want the pound to touch the sill plate  you have to take into consideration the  size of the header as well as the pocket  which may be as many as three or four  inches a pocket that the raw gets  threaded through the head deduct that  measurement from the 24 inch tear and  install a curtain rod at that height or  simply measure from the bottom of the  pocket to the bottom of the curb and  install the curtain rod at that height  so if you want your tears to touch the  sill plate you don&amp;#39;t install the raw 24  inches high which would be on here and  it would leave the curtains off the sill  plate a couple inches you would measure  from the bottom of the pocket to the  bottom of the curtain which is probably  in this case 21 and a half inches and  install the raw 21 and a half inches off  the sill plate which will allow your  tears just touch the sill plate well  that just about does it Mary I hope I  was helpful with my measuring guide to  installing to your curtains if anyone  has any questions about curtains or  would like me to do a video on any  curtains valances things of that nature  please add a comment on youtube or email  me at customer service at swags galore  calm and if you&amp;#39;re in the market for  affordable window treatments I encourage  you to go to America&amp;#39;s online curtain  superstore ww swags galore calm and see  the

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="3.419">we tidy up the home getting ready for  the week right so one of those things  that we hate to do every single week or  once a week twice a week however often  is cleaning the toilet polishing the  throne keeping it fresh whatever it is  you want to call it it stinks and we  don&amp;#39;t like it and a professor Amos is a  gentleman that we adore he&amp;#39;s one of our  American dreamers were so inspired by  him he spent his whole career over 40  years traveling the world to find us  items that help us work smarter not  harder and he&amp;#39;s found a way that&amp;#39;s  different from any other toilet cleaner  this one&amp;#39;s got no bleach no ammonia  you&amp;#39;re looking at the fast toilet  cleaner and you&amp;#39;re getting a whole  system because you&amp;#39;re also getting the  toilet tablets as well now you&amp;#39;re  getting this huge configuration because  each one of these bottles is creating 24  different cleans so this configuration  is 48 toilet cleans if you count it like  that it&amp;#39;s one ounce that you need that&amp;#39;s  all you need and then you&amp;#39;re getting  think of it as like the breath mint for  the the tank on the toilet each one of  those you&amp;#39;re gonna get four of the  emerald clean time-release tablets  they&amp;#39;re 30 days each I got four months  work but unlike any toilet cleaner none  of those harsh chemicals like the  ammonia is like the bleaches the things  you got to wear a gas mask for we&amp;#39;ve got  a great price break for you today on a  kit that you have love for ever it&amp;#39;s  always been a customer pick because of  the Royal Treatment you&amp;#39;re getting this  home for less than five bucks you can&amp;#39;t  buy any toilet cleaner anywhere for five  bucks and to tell us all about it is our  brand expert professor Amos family was  anji corley and this is great cuz we  don&amp;#39;t like doing it so anything that&amp;#39;s  gonna make it easier or goodness sign me  up all right how about I make like the  stinkiest nastiest job fun again easy  maybe we should say you talk about the  royal treatment the throne is where  we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about today so yes the  products are different the professor&amp;#39;s  been doing this for so long he&amp;#39;s so much  fun you love his energy it&amp;#39;s being part  of the a-team is different because when  you work with products like these every  day you&amp;#39;re like why didn&amp;#39;t I think of  that  so here&amp;#39;s let me just show you exactly  what I&amp;#39;m talking about let me show you  this bowl this does not tank for a  second here because what happens is if  you see that kind of ring  around the tank its that rust line  Leslie that&amp;#39;s where we get the hard  water that&amp;#39;s all the Russian it comes in  from your home through your tank goes  down through your bowl right so we&amp;#39;re  gonna tell you that this is a toilet and  a tank cleaner but let me just show you  how ours is so different from everything  else this is what you&amp;#39;re used to doing  right you take your your other liquids  because we love them okay they have it  sometimes in dreams sometimes a nice  smell and we think all right let&amp;#39;s get  busy let&amp;#39;s put it around the tank but  watch this here&amp;#39;s ours first of all  color-changing technology  whoa from green bottle yeah to blue when  it&amp;#39;s activated in the water this is a  thick proprietary clinging formulas  cooking time right is cool but let me  show you why ours does not have the  bleach and an ammonia because it causes  a reaction that doesn&amp;#39;t give you quite  such a pleasant experience when you&amp;#39;re  talking about the tank and your bowl as  well so imagine these are our bowls and  I&amp;#39;ll go over to the throne in a second  but let me show you this is actually  liquid rust so I&amp;#39;m gonna take some of  this rust and I&amp;#39;m gonna put it in each  and every one of these bowls I want you  to watch because instantly you&amp;#39;re gonna  see a reaction that isn&amp;#39;t really cool  right because it gives you this kind of  bad head of lettuce just rotten looking  sludge it&amp;#39;s ineffective clean that&amp;#39;s  what we really want to show you so  liquid rust in all of it starting from  the beginning you start to see this  cloudy kind of swirly nasty looking if  you saw this little thing you&amp;#39;d throw it  out yeah it looks like it&amp;#39;s solidifying  right so sometimes when you look in your  tank or look in your bowl you&amp;#39;re seeing  this it isn&amp;#39;t waste that you&amp;#39;re seeing  you&amp;#39;re actually seeing the reaction of  the rust and with the bleach and ammonia  right you&amp;#39;re not getting that effective  cleanly what you&amp;#39;d have there&amp;#39;s one and  it&amp;#39;s gonna keep growing come over to the  next one it looks like like a little  tornado that&amp;#39;s going on inside of your  ball look at that so when you see that  water line that looks stained we know  that these these materials are porous so  they really absorb all those odors all  the wastes you&amp;#39;re not getting that  deodorize clean experience that you want  and we want that right so we can move on  so borrowers actually neutralizes the  rust you can see the label it&amp;#39;s in  between your neutralizes that hard water  that  that limes give the normal water  deposits that we get because this one  doesn&amp;#39;t have the bleaches and the  ammonia that&amp;#39;s right okay this does you  know what I was thinking too because  it&amp;#39;s kind of solidifying this is what&amp;#39;s  now getting in the tiny little drain  hole exactly see that line see that  build-up so sometimes if you look  underneath your throne we&amp;#39;re gonna go  over to one now yeah you see that it&amp;#39;s  not always waste in waste matter it  could be the staining from the rust from  the hard water I&amp;#39;m gonna come over here  because I want to show you how quick  this is it&amp;#39;s got an easy nozzle remember  you&amp;#39;re getting two of the 24 ounce  bottles you&amp;#39;re not gonna use the whole  thing right you only use an ounce now so  that means 48 cleans with this  configuration and then you&amp;#39;re getting  the four emerald clean time-release  sometimes you brush your teeth and  you&amp;#39;re like we might need a little bit  more gargle you grabbed me years ago  what you&amp;#39;re doing so you simply take  your nozzle you flip up at the top it&amp;#39;s  so easy to get right under the rim and  you take that super effective deodorize  clean you it&amp;#39;s gonna remove that rust  remove that hard water remove the lime  scale all the build-up that kind of  cakes around whether you have one whole  you know these new flushes you know  they&amp;#39;re just so cute right it&amp;#39;s one gush  of water but you still get build-up yeah  you&amp;#39;re not getting that good clean rinse  or if you&amp;#39;ve got holes all around which  I&amp;#39;m gonna show you this throne in a  second you&amp;#39;ve got to get under there you  gonna clean it out you&amp;#39;re gonna do  dereyes it so if you look underneath  here let me get the camera really good  all right so all around here you&amp;#39;ve got  those holes right that&amp;#39;s where it all  builds up so I simply pop open the top  it gets right on in there  it&amp;#39;s got cling-time it&amp;#39;s a thick formula  and that&amp;#39;s what you want you want it to  really hold on to the bolt and deodorize  and clean as it goes down it&amp;#39;s so simple  right yeah because of course is better  jaffas we&amp;#39;d rather do whether it&amp;#39;s hey  enjoying our spring time the kids these  graduations all of our different events  and outings have people coming over -  yes  the panic and you&amp;#39;re like is my house in  tip-top shape are my bathrooms clean  right yeah so let me give it the royal  flush  yeah okay now I&amp;#39;m gonna go back  underneath and it smells so minty it  smells so exuberant this is just one  place hey you got a lot of people coming  in and out of the bathroom look at that  all right we want it to be clean and  sparkly and it&amp;#39;s not gonna absorb all  the hard water all the rest into the  pores because it works differently  ceramic because that&amp;#39;s just it you know  Angie if I wanted to I could go to the  supermarket right buy any toilet cleaner  but they&amp;#39;re all working the same using  the ammonia&amp;#39;s and the bleaches sometimes  that that hard chemical is not  necessarily the best way yes professor  Amos has found a way this is why it&amp;#39;s  become your favorite for the past five  years why we adore professor Amos he  really makes great products and  solutions but it works differently  without the bleach without the ammonia  so you don&amp;#39;t get that reaction and all  that stuff that&amp;#39;s clogging up all of  those sorts are more effective clean so  what are you gonna pay so let me show  you the time-released tablets these are  fabulous they last 30 days again it&amp;#39;s  that pressure cute yeah so let me grab  these normally you would never want to  touch these because your fingers would  be blue or white forever so I&amp;#39;m just  gonna drop all these tablets in I just  dropped ours in again time-released  tablet so you just simply open it up  drop it in your tank so this is gonna  keep that bowl fresher longer it&amp;#39;s gonna  keep it deodorize keep it clean give you  that wonderful mess you&amp;#39;re in the water  gray is gonna turn okay why not have a  little bit of that so again I&amp;#39;m gonna  take our liquid rust let me move that  put it show you the 50 each and every  one remember the bleach and by the way  and by the way this is a price break  this kit is normally $35 Jared we&amp;#39;ve got  it at 22 95 and look it look do you see  the flex pay at 4 dollars and 59 cents  that&amp;#39;s just for this weekend on your  customer favorite way to clean the  toilet you know listen I said I&amp;#39;m gonna  make like the nasty stinky job like cool  why not do that it&amp;#39;s not gonna be fun  but it&amp;#39;s definitely gonna be easier  that&amp;#39;s right I mean come on your boys  you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of miss spots  right  we want to do a lot of cleaning so here  we are again I want to show you what  rust and bleach and ammonia do to your  bowl how they react that each other  exactly in the tank please don&amp;#39;t forget  your tank this is a tank cleaner as well  but look what happens in each and every  bowl that&amp;#39;s every color tablet you  probably used in the past and how ours  are different is that once you drop it  in Natalie do you get that cleaning &amp;amp;  deodorize experience you get that  wonderful smell but come on we want it  clean we&amp;#39;re gonna help you maintain that  clean longer so we neutralize the rust  the lime scale the hard water I put the  same amount of rust and each and every  one of this different yeah yeah and  that&amp;#39;s just it you know you don&amp;#39;t have  to open the windows and air out the  bathroom because there&amp;#39;s no bleachers no  ammonia it is different from everything  we use and I promise you wouldn&amp;#39;t be  here all this time if it didn&amp;#39;t work if  you didn&amp;#39;t love it take advantage of  this deal today it&amp;#39;s four dollars and

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="2.87" dur="4.239">everybody it&amp;#39;s windy welcome I&amp;#39;m so  excited you&amp;#39;re here today we are gonna  be playing with the new cookie cutter  Halloween and teeny tiny wishes which  isn&amp;#39;t new but it&amp;#39;s a fun set and the  cookie cutter Halloween set is in the  new holiday catalog and while we&amp;#39;re on  the subject of holiday catalogues let me  share some information with you I found  out this week that the mailing selector  I used to mail all my holiday catalogs  should have those catalogs arriving to  you this week if you do not receive your  holiday catalog this week and you&amp;#39;re a  regular customer of mine please let me  know  so if Friday comes and you&amp;#39;ve not  received a holiday catalog for me I  absolutely need to know that if you&amp;#39;re a  regular customer now if you&amp;#39;re not a  regular customer and you still want a  catalog you are more than welcome to  have one for free you just need to email  me and let me know that okay so I&amp;#39;ve  stamped three of these really cute  little cookie cutter monsters and I used  tuxedo memento black ink because I&amp;#39;m  gonna do some Copic coloring and I  absolutely love how these monsters  turned out they&amp;#39;re so cute and we&amp;#39;re  just gonna go right in and color so I&amp;#39;m  speeding this up just because I know you  probably don&amp;#39;t want to sit and watch me  color forever  and this is e zero zero zero zero it&amp;#39;s a  super super light skin tone color and I  wanted that because this is a little  vampire so he should not have dark skin  right I mean he should be like looking  like he&amp;#39;s pretty much dead and I&amp;#39;m  coloring his shirt in grey and then I&amp;#39;m  coloring his vest in red and I&amp;#39;m going  to use our seventeen our 27 and our 29 I  think our 24 and our 29 sorry about that  I&amp;#39;m still really learning my Copic  colors as far as the numbers are  concerned and so I don&amp;#39;t really I&amp;#39;m not  very good about showing them here and  and letting you know what they are  because frankly I don&amp;#39;t figure you  really care that much but if you guys  want me to make sure I share my numbers  that  using comment below and let me know okay  so basically you just go in with the  lightest red I covered the whole surface  then I&amp;#39;m going in with my medium tone  and then my darker tone just to add a  little bit of shading on his vest  there&amp;#39;s not a lot of shading happening  here because this card doesn&amp;#39;t really  call for a light source because  everything is gonna get punched out and  put kind of in the middle of a card so  um anyway that&amp;#39;s that alright we&amp;#39;re  gonna move on to the skeleton and the  mummy and both of them use the C ones so  I&amp;#39;m using c1 c3 c5 just to add a little  bit of shading because that actually  really helps your white pop and make it  look more white which trust me I  understand how crazy that sounds but  it&amp;#39;s actually true and then when you add  some of the gray element it really makes  it stand out and look like a white  skeleton I don&amp;#39;t get it I don&amp;#39;t get how  it works I just know it works and so I&amp;#39;m  adding quite a bit of grey shading to  this mummy because I really want the  middle of him to stand out and I&amp;#39;m just  using a process that it&amp;#39;s called  feathering or flicking depending on who  you learn from and you&amp;#39;re just literally  sorry about my dog barking sorry about  that and you&amp;#39;re literally just flicking  the pen using a really light touch and  flicking the pen inur&amp;#39;d  and then going ahead and adding here  some c3 I think this is what it is c3  and then I&amp;#39;m going to be adding some c5  and then I&amp;#39;m blending it back out with  some c1 and it&amp;#39;ll just end up having  this really soft edge and then I&amp;#39;m gonna  go over the entire thing and use my  colorless blender and that will kind of  even soften those edges even more the  edges when I&amp;#39;m saying the edges I&amp;#39;m  referring to the edges inside of this  little mummy so you can see this really  highlights the white and makes that  white really stand out and gives  dimension to this little mummy it kind  of makes them feel 3d  and so it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite  techniques to do actually it&amp;#39;s something  that I really resisted doing when I  first started using kopecks because in  my head I&amp;#39;m like it&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s not gonna  look white or the items not gonna look  white if I use a bunch of gray but it  turns out it does and then it also makes  them really dimensional so I went  outside the lines here just in a couple  places so I just went and used my  colorless blender to push that color  back in and it worked great so here&amp;#39;s  what&amp;#39;s fun about this there&amp;#39;s another  bundle in the holiday catalog that comes  with like a gingerbread man and some  other cute little guys and it uses this  punch and it&amp;#39;s a bundle however when you  purchase that bundle then you can  purchase this stamp set and you already  have the punch so this is like on my  number one list of things to purchase on  the holiday catalog for you would be  purchasing the cookie cutter bundle so  that you get the Christmassy little  cookie cutter guys and the punch and  then purchasing the Halloween so okay  this is something I wanted to show you I  am cutting this paper I cut an inch and  a half off this edge so now this paper  is 7 by 11 and then I&amp;#39;m cutting it again  at the six inch mark and then I&amp;#39;m gonna  turn the paper and score at three and a  half so now I have a six inch by three  and a half size card and the other piece  of cardstock that I have left over I&amp;#39;m  gonna score at three and a half and it&amp;#39;s  now a five inch by three and a half inch  card so that gives you two card bases  that are different sizes and I could  have just scored it all the way down at  the three and a half mark and then cut  it but that gives you two separate card  pieces that are fun different sizes but  you get two cards out of one sheet of  paper so I wanted to show you that okay  so tomorrow I&amp;#39;m going to show you how I  use that little leftover piece so make  sure you come by because I have a blog  hop happening it won&amp;#39;t be I won&amp;#39;t have a  video it&amp;#39;s just gonna be on my blog okay  so then there&amp;#39;s a super adorable  designer series paper in the holiday  catalog that is for Halloween  and the name of it is escaping me right  now but I&amp;#39;ll have it all of my supplies  are always listed on my blog and there&amp;#39;s  always a link to my blog in the  description of my videos so you click  there and then you can go and see where  all I get all my supplies or where I use  them blah blah blah okay so this paper  is really fun it looks like a spider web  and then I have this paper and this is  all from the same paper packet this is  really really cute this is designer  series paper with little bats all over  it and it layers right on top so my  friend Katina Martinez who happens to  live a couple blocks from me is a  Stampin Up demonstrator she&amp;#39;s actually  on my team and she does paper chairs  I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve ever heard of a  paper share but basically you end up  getting like 6x6 sheets of every paper  that&amp;#39;s in the catalogue I don&amp;#39;t do those  because she does them so I&amp;#39;m gonna link  to her website here on my video I&amp;#39;m also  going to link um in my blog to her so  that if you want to get a paper share go  ahead and purchase a paper share from  her even if you&amp;#39;re my customer don&amp;#39;t  feel weird about that it&amp;#39;s fine and I  don&amp;#39;t do paper shares and so if you need  a paper share and you want to get on her  list for paper shares then you can go  ahead and go to her blog and get on that  list to get a paper share from her okay  so there&amp;#39;s this really pretty new twine  available in the holiday catalog and  it&amp;#39;s gray and black and I used it to  just tie a little bow right here going  all the way around this card because I  thought it needed a little something for  my eyeball to go towards and then I&amp;#39;m  gonna add all my little monsters to the  front of this card and oh actually I  lied I&amp;#39;m gonna stamp first I&amp;#39;m gonna use  pumpkin pie ink to stamp my little happy  Halloween sentiment and the thing about  these cookie cutter stamps is that they  don&amp;#39;t have sentiments so you got to make  sure you have a sentiment separately if  you&amp;#39;re wanting to stamp one so I went  ahead and stamped happy Halloween in  pumpkin pie and then I&amp;#39;m gonna add my  little monsters and I have to tell you  really quick I am going to be giving  these  to my cousin one of them&amp;#39;s gonna go to  my cousin who&amp;#39;s now living in Long Beach  because she started Long Beach  University and then another friend of  mine who she&amp;#39;s actually a friend she&amp;#39;s  actually a sister of a friend so and she  is going to Yale and I&amp;#39;m so excited to  know somebody going to yell and this is  why because of Gilmore Girls I&amp;#39;m a huge  Gilmore Girls fan I love Gilmore Girls  and Rory went to Yale and so now I feel  like I am smarter by proxy because I  know somebody that&amp;#39;s going to Yale and  so I&amp;#39;m going to send her a happy  Halloween goodie box as well as my  cousin that&amp;#39;s living in Long Beach so  you see the fly on my hand  okay that&amp;#39;s horrifying but I have to  have to tell you what&amp;#39;s going on here so  I live in the country you know that I&amp;#39;ve  told you several times I&amp;#39;m sure if  you&amp;#39;re new to my channel now you know  and we have flies it&amp;#39;s gross and we get  it flies really bad this time of year  really bad because we have a little fare  that&amp;#39;s local here in town and when the  fare leaves there&amp;#39;s horse poop and cow  poop and chicken poop and bird poop and  every kind of poop you can imagine and  we end up with a bunch of flies and it&amp;#39;s  so super gross so that&amp;#39;s why you saw fly  on my hand and I was horrified but I&amp;#39;m  like that&amp;#39;s my life I cannot reshoot a  whole video because of one stupid fly so  so that&amp;#39;s what happened so I&amp;#39;m making  now some really cute envelopes for these  cards because their cards are a funky  shape so I had to make my own envelopes  which was great because I love this  paper so I&amp;#39;m using an 8x8 piece of paper  here and then I am scoring it originally  at the 3 and 1/8 inch and then just  going along the score lines this is our  envelope punch board I highly recommend  that you own one of these if you don&amp;#39;t  have an envelope punch board you totally  need one because if you make an envelope  that&amp;#39;s a weird size then you have an  envelope maker and the it makes pretty  much every size you can possibly imagine  and the instructions  for each size envelope are right on the  envelope punch board so I mean it&amp;#39;s just  fantastic you don&amp;#39;t have to do any other  extra work you just look right on the  board itself and then you make your  envelope and I think they&amp;#39;re like 20  bucks they&amp;#39;re not really expensive I  sell them in my online store so if you  need one make sure you pick one up and  when you place your next order with me  okay so I&amp;#39;m using fast fuse adhesive on  this because um envelopes tend to want  to pull away from each other like it it  tends to want to come apart so I&amp;#39;m using  my bone folder to just make those score  lines extra secure and then I&amp;#39;m using my  fast fuse adhesive to really make sure  that this envelope sticks together well  I don&amp;#39;t want it coming apart before it  gets to its recipient and then I&amp;#39;ll just  tie a ribbon around it to keep it closed  okay so that is my envelope and my card  and I just love how they turned out  they&amp;#39;re so much fun and I really hope  that you are excited as I am about the  holiday catalog every single blog post  and video I do from now until the  holiday catalog launches is going to  feature holiday product because I want  you to see all the really cool items  that are going to be available to you to  purchase and you can see more pictures  have more information over on my blog  once again hang tight if you haven&amp;#39;t  gotten a catalog from me yet it&amp;#39;s just  because the selector takes a little  while hopefully your husband didn&amp;#39;t pick  up the mail and see that there was a  Stampin Up catalog in there and throw it  in the trash but if he did you can  certainly get another one from me so  after this week like I said if you  haven&amp;#39;t gotten your catalog make sure  you&amp;#39;d hit me up ok please click  Subscribe if you&amp;#39;re new to my channel  and you&amp;#39;re not subscribed and give me a  thumbs up if you like this video and I  will see you on Wednesday on YouTube  thanks so much bye bye</text><text start="5.37"

tomorrow because tiny  wanted to come but she has a doctor&amp;#39;s  appointment today at like 2:45 and it is  currently two o&amp;#39;clock so we&amp;#39;re gonna go  tomorrow to get pedicures so I am  getting ready to film my little office  space for we&amp;#39;re only gonna be talking  about this section here and then when I  get more of the room put together we&amp;#39;ll  eventually talk about the entire room  together  also how cute is this cup I&amp;#39;m gonna film  and then I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know where  the day will take us from there my  freaking mic died I was filming so I was  gonna go take off this makeup while I  shot the b-roll I&amp;#39;m so glad that I  didn&amp;#39;t because I just noticed that the  mic battery light was not on and I just  checked the footage and only two minutes  of me talking will record it and then  the mic died so I&amp;#39;m glad that I kept  this makeup on because now I have to  refill the video I hope I remember  everything that I said but I&amp;#39;m just  happy that I did not take off this  makeup these brought me some Cheerios I  did not thank you so I haven&amp;#39;t even  started editing yet um I have just been  looking at hotels because I told you  guys we&amp;#39;re going to Yosemite and I do  have a hotel booked but there&amp;#39;s like  contradicting facts on the internet some  places are saying that the logic we&amp;#39;re  saying it&amp;#39;s only 3 miles away but then  when I put it in on the maps it says  it&amp;#39;s like an hour to the valleys so I&amp;#39;m  trying to figure that out and see if I  need to move our hotel to like a closer  Lodge and I haven&amp;#39;t even uploaded any of  the footage into the computer yet  because I have been transferring all of  my Final Cut files to an external hard  drive I&amp;#39;ll do those randomly no just to  have like a fresh start and the computer  just runs faster I actually have the I  think I have like 5 terabytes of memory  on this laptop so it actually does hold  a lot of [ __ ] but it&amp;#39;s been transferring  3.17 terabytes for like the last I don&amp;#39;t  know seven hours and it still has four  hours to go also we&amp;#39;re only in Yosemite  for two days we have basically two full  days there we&amp;#39;re gonna really early  everyday that we&amp;#39;re there so we just  have like a full day of [ __ ] we&amp;#39;re not  doing anything crazy like we&amp;#39;re not  climbing Half Dome or anything like that  you know um but I am really really  excited to see you somebody I&amp;#39;ve just  been watching like other people&amp;#39;s blogs  and getting pumped for it  I think we have like one maybe two  national parks in Florida homes like the  Everglades National Park I&amp;#39;m not going  there okay  I&amp;#39;m from Florida okay the Everglades I&amp;#39;m  not into it  alligators scare me I think Disney World  is Florida&amp;#39;s National Park I&amp;#39;m just  kidding so I&amp;#39;m going to finish up some  emails that I have finished the  Housewives get in the shower and I will  see you guys bright and early tomorrow  probably right around coffee time I know  it seems like we haven&amp;#39;t left but it is  the next day it&amp;#39;s Coffee time I think  it&amp;#39;s around 10:00 in the morning I&amp;#39;m  trying to import all my footage because  finally after I think 12 hours it  switched not switched it transferred the  footage onto my external hard drive so  now I have a fresh new computer right to  go to my little light guys so we needed  some light I had to switch camera lenses  because I&amp;#39;m sure the footage is in this  video but there&amp;#39;s like a weird noise  happening in the video this camera just  can&amp;#39;t handle the lens that was on it I  like the quality more on the other lens  but this lens just can&amp;#39;t he and this  camera can handle this lens so I&amp;#39;m gonna  do some editing I think it&amp;#39;s like 10:00  in the morning drink this coffee and  then go get a pedicure and then probably  just come back and I did some more again  I know it seems like I just got a  pedicure but it&amp;#39;s been  football season

insurance  company hasn&amp;#39;t gotten back to them I  don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s like this in other  states but in Florida it&amp;#39;s free to get  your windshield replaced no matter what  if you crack it if it needs to be  repaired or anything like that if you  have insurance  um it&amp;#39;s free 99 so I guess I&amp;#39;m gonna  have to cut well I&amp;#39;m not even gonna call  him on

Tuesday I&amp;#39;m hoping that I don&amp;#39;t have any  trouble like uploading or anything like  that while we&amp;#39;re in Yosemite because  sure how the internet it&amp;#39;s gonna be we  are staying at a lodge but we&amp;#39;re saying  like in a little cottage that&amp;#39;s like you  have to walk away from the lodge but I&amp;#39;m  assuming that the lodge is gonna have  Wi-Fi so if anything I&amp;#39;ll be able to  upload in there but I just hope that I&amp;#39;m  able to upload I was gonna get one of  those like a little wireless um like  hotspot wireless hotspot can use so you  got to sign up like you&amp;#39;re getting a  whole new damn phone and I was just like  I only want to use it like two times and  I don&amp;#39;t want to pay like a large ass  monthly service it was like you gotta  extend your contract and all kinds of  [ __ ] so I was just like you know what  mama don&amp;#39;t eat that I&amp;#39;ll try to find  Wi-Fi where I can if anything we&amp;#39;ll just

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="4.95">hey guys so welcome back to my channel  if you&amp;#39;re new here hello my name is  Lilly and today I&amp;#39;m gonna be doing a  video on a lot of meals and snacks and  just kind of tips on food that it&amp;#39;s  going to make it a little bit more tasty  and easy and quick if you&amp;#39;re trying to  eat healthier you know so the first  thing I do in the morning when I wake up  your body is pretty dehydrated just  because you&amp;#39;ve spent you know over eight  hours ish without any water so I like to  drink a whole cup of water as soon as I  get up and I usually go to the gym and I  take my hydro flask with me this hydro  flask is 40 ounces of water so I usually  try to drink one whole one by the time I  get home from the gym and then I try to  drink one more throughout the day two  more if it&amp;#39;s like a super super good day  you know and of course if you follow me  on Instagram if you&amp;#39;ve seen I think it  was a day in the life video I did buy a  green juice so 99% of the time is the  first thing I consume well actually the  next thing is the first thing I consume  but this is the second thing and this is  just a lot of stuff in one juice in my  Vitamix and it&amp;#39;s just helped me so much  with my digestion with weight loss and  all of that so the first thing that I  drink before the green juice is apple  cider vinegar this also helps a lot with  stomach bloating and digestion as well  so I squeezed a little bit of lemon in  there that I have left over from my  green juice and I just do two capfuls  and some water I know you&amp;#39;re supposed to  do like 8 ounces of water with this but  I just do maybe half that I just do like  this little cup and I drink this and  then I down my green juice right after  because it is just not it does not taste  good at all if you drink this you know  that it is not delicious at all so yeah  I just down the green juice you&amp;#39;re gonna  see me making like a weird face but it  is not the green juice it&amp;#39;s just like  the aftertaste of the apple cider  vinegar but I also like to put it in a  glass my green juice because it&amp;#39;s easier  to clean once I&amp;#39;m done  and the next thing that I want to share  with you guys is an acai bowl these are  so bomb me and my husband and the kids  have been pretty obsessed with them  lately  so you just pretty much add whatever  frozen fruit you want to it and the acai  so I for me I usually just do half of a  pouch of the acai because it is a lot  especially with the toppings so you  could also just freeze your own  fruit and vegetables to put in here so  yeah you just kind of mix it all up I  like to add them almond milk little by  little instead of like putting a bunch  just because you don&amp;#39;t want it to be too  watery and you don&amp;#39;t want it to be too  thick so this helps also with a little  little plunger thing in there just kind  of make sure everything gets nice and  smooth so I this day I made a whole  pouch because I was sharing with the  kids they have really been loving these  as well  so kind of me I love granola so I kind  of put it like granola and a lot of  things so this is just kind of like what  I would do with yogurt you can add  whatever you want they ask for granola  shredded coconut and then a little bit  just a little dab of some chocolate  chips in there and I added blueberries  also oh and I also forgot to mention  hemp arts I do add these to their  oatmeal usually and there are cyi Bulls  like pretty much anything like that they  really enjoy these because they can kind  of like tell me what they want in it and  then I can sneak in a few things you  know but yeah so to mine the only thing  I do different is add half of a serving  of protein powder it&amp;#39;s really really  nice that you can add a protein powder  to a lot of things not just making  protein shakes so you can just kind of  get creative with it so I also added  granola to mine and then I did a whole  banana and I realized that I was running  out of room in this little Bowl so just  because this morning in particular I  didn&amp;#39;t have my green juice because I  didn&amp;#39;t have a few ingredients so I made  myself like an extra extra big bowl to  get a little bit more calories so I did  add a whole banana  some hemp parts and some coconut flakes  I just keep it super simple you should  see my husband&amp;#39;s acai bowls they&amp;#39;re just  like he has all kinds of stuff in it so  this isn&amp;#39;t too bad  okay so now we&amp;#39;re gonna move on to lunch  ish sometimes I&amp;#39;ll have this for  breakfast - I don&amp;#39;t really care I have  whatever meal I&amp;#39;m craving for you know  whenever time of the day but I&amp;#39;m gonna  show you guys three different ways that  I make avocado toast like a laziest way  is this one and this one has no egg on  it so it&amp;#39;s just  avvocato and tomato slices on top and  you don&amp;#39;t want to cook it you just you  know toast the bread and then I add some  salt and pepper and what is the other  one called el paprika and it adds a  little more flavor so usually when I do  it like this it&amp;#39;s because I don&amp;#39;t have  eggs or because I just don&amp;#39;t feel like  having eggs and this is just all  personal preference sometimes I&amp;#39;ll do  two of these sometimes I&amp;#39;ll do one like  I&amp;#39;m doing today and I&amp;#39;ll add a side with  it a snack so it&amp;#39;s all up to you what  how much carbs you want to eat how much  of whatever you want to eat calories etc  so this is my favorite yogurt I will be  talking a little bit more about it later  in the video because I do add it at the  end but I just do this yogurt with  granola and that&amp;#39;s it  so by the time I&amp;#39;m eating my lunch I&amp;#39;m  usually on my second hydro flask so get  that water in people it&amp;#39;s good for  everything in your body in out all the  way around so don&amp;#39;t slack on your water  this is literally what makes me gain a  few pounds every week if I&amp;#39;m not on top  of it with my water so but if I am going  to use eggs I like to watch my oil I  just do a half tablespoon also don&amp;#39;t use  a big pan if you&amp;#39;re going to you know  you do oil because you add more oil to  cover the pan so I like to use a smaller  pan and I will just do some egg whites  whatever preference of you know how  amount that you want it&amp;#39;s like I said  you can do two breads if you want or you  can just do one so whatever you like so  again it&amp;#39;s avocado on the toast with the  egg whites on top you could also add  vegetables into the egg whites you can  add tomatoes to the egg whites if you  want so that&amp;#39;s also your preference so  this particular day I just did add  whites with salt and pepper paprika and  called it a day  so on this day I did have one toast with  the egg whites and avocado and all the  spices and I didn&amp;#39;t have like a snack  side with it I just drank my green juice  with it so again personal preference  just listen to your body and then next  avocado toast the last one is like  loaded basically loaded avocado toast so  this is one egg like just regular egg  with some egg whites and two toasts and  some bell pepper onion and tomato if I&amp;#39;m  starving and I don&amp;#39;t want to be anything  too unhealthy that&amp;#39;s definitely what I  go for  so this day I was drinking it with my  green juice as well so moving right  along apparently I&amp;#39;m going to show you  guys two things that we meal prep pretty  much on a regular basis so this is an  shilada so I like to use the extreme  tortillas I will link them below so you  guys know what I&amp;#39;m talking about  they are just healthier tortillas  they&amp;#39;re the base basil tomato  hazal I hate when I say tortillas when  I&amp;#39;m talking in English tortillas  tomato-basil tortillas and they&amp;#39;re so  good and it&amp;#39;s just onion zucchini black  beans and I just saute all that like  cook it with the enchilada sauce just  put enchilada sauce on top and you can  ex out on the cheese if you want but I  just put a little cheese a little bit of  cheese don&amp;#39;t hurt nobody  and then the next lunch again I&amp;#39;ll eat  then she let us for lunch or dinner  doesn&amp;#39;t matter or this salad so this is  Caesar salad chicken Caesar salad like  homemade so you just cut up some romaine  lettuce and add some chicken but my  little secret sauce is this pita chips  on the bottom we went to a restaurant a  while back with my sister-in-law and  they like served the Caesar salad like  this and I just haven&amp;#39;t been able to go  back to normal like just croutons so  these are just healthier than croutons  and then also watch your calories on the  dressing you just want to make sure  you&amp;#39;re not overdoing it because you can  easily overdo it that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s for sure  so this light dressing really helps you  know just keep the fat not as high as  normal you know kind of thing that was  cute wasn&amp;#39;t that but yeah so this is  also super easy you can prep your  chicken have it ready to go and just  whip it up in five minutes  you know and lastly it&amp;#39;s the famous  chili that I&amp;#39;ve been making for like  ever  I&amp;#39;ll take little breaks from it because  I feel like I have it too much but I  will link the page that I got this  recipe below the only difference is that  we add I think we have lentils to it and  the girl in the video doesn&amp;#39;t but it&amp;#39;s  basically a lot of bomb stuff and it&amp;#39;s a  vegan chili it doesn&amp;#39;t have any meat in  it so it&amp;#39;s also cost friendly I also  like with enchiladas it&amp;#39;s just so much  easier to just do black beans and the  vegetables it&amp;#39;s just cheaper and it  saves you some McCoy you know you don&amp;#39;t  have to like heat up any meat or cooking  meat to make it so it&amp;#39;s also faster so  yeah faster cheaper better you know so  yeah and these last few that I&amp;#39;m going  to share with you guys  are just kind of snack things so if  you&amp;#39;re craving a coffee lately I have  not done much coffee and when I do I get  like super wired and I didn&amp;#39;t used to  before so that&amp;#39;s how I know I&amp;#39;m like  easing up on the coffee but I suggest  just buy an iced or hot black coffee and  then add whatever creamer you want at  home again just watch your calories  don&amp;#39;t do too much just do enough until  it tastes good to you so the last thing  is this yogurt I love this yogurt it  comes in different flavors but me I am  just a knob you know so I just like the  vanilla flavor with granola the kids  love the strawberry the mango so they  have a bunch of other flavors and this  is a soy yogurt so it&amp;#39;s non-dairy which  is awesome for me the only dairy we buy  at home is literally cheese that&amp;#39;s it so  we do vegan butter we do the soy stuff  if it&amp;#39;s good if we like it so we have  been loving these yogurts for forever  now  and lastly it&amp;#39;s good old Trail Mix I  forgot about this trail mix and again  watch your servings but this is good if  you&amp;#39;re craving something with a little  bit of salt and sweet and it&amp;#39;s not going  to be you know anything candy related or  chips I personally like a crunch that&amp;#39;s  why I like granola and stuff and this  trail mix in particular so we got this  one at Costco so yeah basically our  thing is just to find healthier  alternatives for things we already like  you know we&amp;#39;re Mexican so we like  Mexican food so it&amp;#39;s always good to just  find you know things that are just a  little bit healthier you know to make it  easier on ourselves but that&amp;#39;s going to  be it for this video guys I hope you  enjoyed it it took me a while to get all  these clips but hopefully it turned out  okay and you guys got some inspo I will  link everything I mentioned down below  and check out any of my other videos and  I will see you guys next time bye</text><text start="2.79" dur="4.799"></text><text start="4.95" dur="5.609"></text><text start="7.589" dur="6.3"></text><text start="10.559"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="5.819">as we read earlier in the article soil  and plant nutrition a gardeners  perspective soil texture is very  important to plants it influences a  plant&amp;#39;s ability to get a stable footing  and the size of the dominant soil  particles also affects how easily water  will drain through soils sands will  easily let water pass through whereas  clays will retain standing water ever  wonder what texture / nominates in your  soil here Mark Richardson director of  horticulture at New England while flower  Society explains an easy method for  determining the composition of your soil  the mason jar test hi I&amp;#39;m Mark  Richardson on the board of culture  director for New England wildflower  society and today we&amp;#39;re going to be  looking at how to evaluate soils in your  garden we&amp;#39;re going to do a really simple  test it&amp;#39;s called a mason jar test and  for this we need several tools the  purpose of the mason jar test is really  to evaluate the percentage of sand silt  and clay in your soils which is a  measure of the soil texture and should  tell you a lot about basic soil  properties like drainage like nutrient  retention and those types of things so  for the mason jar test we need a mason  jar with a lid on it preferably a water  tight lid we need a soil knife or a  trowel or something that we can use to  get a decent scoop of soil out of our  garden we need a little bit of dish soap  only about a teaspoon full of dish soap  but just a tiny bit of dish soap and of  course we need some water and let&amp;#39;s look  at how all these things are going to  work to do the mason jar test  so out in the garden you want to find a  spot that&amp;#39;s you know got a pretty good  representation of the soil type if you  have very different soils across  different parts of your garden you may  want to try to do a soil sample in  multiple locations but for today&amp;#39;s  purposes we&amp;#39;re just going to do a sample  right here in an area of the idea garden  of garden in the woods so first and  foremost we&amp;#39;re going to scrape off any  mulch or organic matter on the top layer  of the soil really try to get down to  you know topsoil essentially so we&amp;#39;ve  scraped off all the leaves and once  we&amp;#39;ve done that we&amp;#39;re going to just you  know dig down about 6 inches or so kind  of fluff up the soil maybe in an area  about 10 8 to 10 inches wide and we want  to make sure that we have about two cups  of soil all together before we put the  soil into the mason jar we want to try  to pick out any rocks or any large roots  or twigs or anything like that that may  be in the in the soil sample so I&amp;#39;ve  pulled out some rocks and as I fill up  the jar I&amp;#39;ll pull out more but we&amp;#39;re  basically just going to take and put  about 2 cups worth of soil into the  mason jar oh if you find any earthworms  you should definitely take them out as  well you&amp;#39;re not going to fill the jar  completely probably about three-quarters  full and then once you&amp;#39;ve filled the jar  and you&amp;#39;re happy with the amount of soil  that you have in it we can take it back  and fill it with water and and prepare  this sample to sit overnight  alright so we&amp;#39;ve got our jar full of  soil and right now what we&amp;#39;re going to  do is just put about a teaspoon full of  dish soap in it the purpose for the dish  soap is just to break up some of the  surface area make it a little bit easier  for the soil to break apart into its  various particulate sizes and make it a  little bit easier to mix up and settle  out later so I&amp;#39;m just going to put about  a teaspoon or less of this dish soap the  very top of the soil you can measure it  if you like to and then we&amp;#39;re going to  fill the rest of the jar with water  once the jar is full of water we put our  cap on tight we really want to try to  roll this around we don&amp;#39;t want to shake  it violently we just want to roll it  around a little bit like this we want to  try to get all the soil into suspension  so try to get as much of you know as  that water distributed evenly through  the soil sample in the jar as we  possibly can just keep rolling it for a  little while and what we&amp;#39;re basically  doing is we&amp;#39;re taking advantage of the  fact that the text the physical  particles of soil are different weights  and different sizes and so what we&amp;#39;ll  see is as this settles out you&amp;#39;ll start  to see layers develop and all the sand  particles the really heavy particles in  soil the largest particles in soil will  settle to the bottom our silt particles  will settle sort of in a middle layer  above the sand and then any clay  particles will settle to the very top  generally in our area we have very  little clay in our soils and so I don&amp;#39;t  see a whole lot of clay when I do the  mason jar test usually it&amp;#39;s just kind of  a fine dust on the very top of the sand  and the silt layers but once you feel  that it&amp;#39;s adequately mixed you want to  put it someplace and let it sit  overnight it&amp;#39;s going to sit for quite a  while so that it settles out so we&amp;#39;ll  take a look at this actually tomorrow  and and we&amp;#39;ll take some measurements on  it and figure out what our soil textural  class is  you  hi so we&amp;#39;re back it&amp;#39;s the next morning  our soil sample has settled out  overnight into some pretty well-defined  layers although not as well defined as I  might like what we have is a thick band  of sand at the very bottom of the jar a  very small band of silt just above the  sand and then a really thin layer of  clay settled out on top you can also see  that even though this is settled out  overnight the water is still pretty  murky that&amp;#39;s clay that hasn&amp;#39;t quite  settled out of the sample yet and then  if you look closely you can see organic  matter organic matter that&amp;#39;s floated to  the top of the soil sample so there&amp;#39;s  still some organic matter in the soil  that we didn&amp;#39;t get out that&amp;#39;s all  floated up to the top what we need to do  now is figure out what the percent of  sand silt and clay are in the sample so  that we can determine what our soil type  is we pre-measured this because it  looked like it was going to be a little  bit difficult to really do that while  the video was filming what we found was  that we have a soil depth of about three  inches in the jar and two and a quarter  inches of that soil depth our sand which  leaves us with about five eighths of an  inch of a silt layer and a very very  small one a band of clay so we take that  information and we divide it we divide  two and a quarter inches of sand by  three inches of the total soil profile  and we come up with a percentage of 75%  sand and then we divide the five eighths  inch layer of silt by three inches of  soil and we get 21-percent silt so what  we do with those numbers as we look at  what&amp;#39;s called the soil textural triangle  and on the soil textural triangle we see  that we have clay on one side silt on  the other side and then sand on the very  bottom and what we do is take our  numbers so we had 75% sand and we draw  an imaginary line from 75%  to about twenty or twenty one percent  silt we really only need to work with  two numbers because the third number  will just automatically work itself out  and what we find if we follow that  imaginary line up from 75% and down from  twenty or twenty-one percent we followed  right about here right in the heart of a  sandy loam so that tells us that the  sample that we sampled yesterday and  allowed to settle out and this mason jar  test is a sample of sandy loam it has a  high percentage of sand a very small  percentage of silt and we know that we  can make some basic assumptions about  the physical properties that the  moisture properties of that soil sample  based on knowing what the soil textural  class is  you</text><text start="3.81"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s crazy this may be the best deal of  the weekend that&amp;#39;s crazy we have not  just a 26 liter digital convection of  this convection oven  it&amp;#39;s a rotisserie as well we&amp;#39;re  including everything you need and let me  tell you what the way this cooks is  different guys so you&amp;#39;re getting the  ability to cook in a standard way as  well as an infrared way at 120 995  you&amp;#39;re gonna be able to cook the best  pizzas and we&amp;#39;re gonna do five flex  payments on this $25.99 on your credit  card let&amp;#39;s get this in this will be  cooked full we&amp;#39;re finished here okay  you crank it all the way to 450 now why  is conviction important for a pizza it&amp;#39;s  important because you want that heat  circulating you want it to be really hot  all the time and here the proof is in  the pudding so you know what that might  need another one minute so let&amp;#39;s come  back to it pizzas pizza always needs an  extra minute okay come over here because  this is totally ready now we&amp;#39;ve switched  the set in the oven by the way is super  easy to use have a look at this chicken  just moving around if you can come down  and show the infrared light I&amp;#39;d really  appreciate it because the infrared light  is what gives it that beautiful crispy  crispy skin I&amp;#39;ll wait for you to get the  camera in position so you&amp;#39;ve got to come  right down low and then shoot up into  the infrared lights here we go sorry I  know that I&amp;#39;m painful about this but  it&amp;#39;s so important look at that see that  infrared light that makes such a big  difference because it makes that skin  gorgeous and crisp all right now

got it you&amp;#39;ve  got to try him if you just used it for  pizza if you just use it for for your  rotisserie chicken and your pizza right  for one 29.95 on your credit card today  to get this home and have a convection  oven  I mean convection oven that you get that  work with your traditional stove how  much does that add to yours oh yeah your  cost it&amp;#39;s crazy right but then you have  this great big huge thing that you&amp;#39;re  gonna have to heat up the whole thing if  you want to make a pizza right or you  can use this it is countertop size I&amp;#39;ll  give you a dimension  this has been slow-cooked so this is the  it has a slow cook function this is the  actual pork have a look at the pork butt  just pull apart it&amp;#39;s so delicate so  decadent you know I mean it&amp;#39;s just such  a beautiful way to cook and have a look  how that just let me turn it over you  know what let me pull it out I know  hopefully her space there okay so now  let me just pull this apart that&amp;#39;s  beautifully cooked it just falls apart  look at that so you&amp;#39;re able to slow cook  in this oven and look at the size of the  pan that I just pulled out of it you  know you can of course use smaller but  you can use something as big as that  what is that Rochelle is that the five  and a half quart yes it is okay five and  a half quart stockpot that we have  available for you and that&amp;#39;s it now yeah  incredible right all right so that&amp;#39;s the  pulled pork truthfully I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ve  ever seen an oven that can slow cook  Catherine my producer have you ever seen  an oven that slow cooks right it&amp;#39;s a  crab where we actually have we actually  have this no we actually have the city  function well I built that in because  you know why I wanted this to be not  only the oven that you melt cheese on  you do pizza on it right you reheat  frozen foods in you know I also wanted  it to be something that had a real  function right so I rotisserie slow  cooking they&amp;#39;re the sort of times they  use you know sometimes have years  whether it&amp;#39;s a birthday or an  anniversary or get-together of some time  you just need a little bit of extra oven  space maybe you&amp;#39;ve got a great herb and  maybe you don&amp;#39;t  this one heats up like that so  especially in the middle of summer right  now you don&amp;#39;t want to be turning it on  your whole wall oven because it takes a  long time to heat up and heats up the  house sometimes because sometimes you&amp;#39;re  cooking for a long period of time this  little guy it lets out about half the  heat of a wall oven it takes about half  the time to heat up so you know if  you&amp;#39;re cooking for one or two this is a  real dream it really just changes every  credible I&amp;#39;ve never seen one that does  that I know you&amp;#39;re gonna pull something  out but then I&amp;#39;d love for you to give us  a little tour sure just because  truthfully I didn&amp;#39;t know you had a slow  cook  convection plus your infrared front plus  your rotisserie let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s start from  the beginning you turn it on and then  all you&amp;#39;ve got here is a little dial and  another button right there right so  you&amp;#39;re gonna choose mode it starts to  flash you can leave it on conviction you  can move to slow cook rotisserie keep  warm is another great function bake  toast roast broil and defrost so you&amp;#39;ve  got all of these that you just scroll on  through right now set the temperature  you press the button obviously I&amp;#39;m on  broil so that&amp;#39;s going to default  straight to 450 because that&amp;#39;s what it  needs to be at so let&amp;#39;s go back to mode  let&amp;#39;s say roast we set the temperature  you then scroll through again do you  want it up do you want to download like  310 do you want to roast it right up  high at 360 do you want to set a timer  you press time then you scroll through  it set it an hour and for fight you know  so you just it is such a brilliant piece  then you press Start and away you go  at preheat and then it just gets going  you know it&amp;#39;s such a good and think  about it this little cavity when I say  little it&amp;#39;s not tiny it&amp;#39;s big enough but  it heats that really really fast which  is what&amp;#39;s so great  defrost mm-hmm to convection to  rotisserie to slow cook have you ever  seen an oven do that because I&amp;#39;ve never  seen an oven  I never seen an oven that is like almost  like a portable counter tops tile I&amp;#39;ve  never seen it with those that many  functions and never at one 29.95 just  just you get little toaster ovens and  stuff like that but this does everything  from broiling the baking de roasting to  rotisserie - I dunno frosting by the way  if one of you picked up on our soup  piece and we have the 8 by 8 or the 9 by  9 dura bake that fits in we also have  that 333 piece a quail all those pieces  fit in sorts of perfect companion here&amp;#39;s  the lasagna and again I&amp;#39;m sliding that  out for two reasons to show off my dura  bake pan of course now that&amp;#39;s the 8 by 8  I believe looks on your band right it&amp;#39;s  already clean but also just so you  understand how to look at this lasagna I  mean so  fantastic so you know you&amp;#39;re able to do  things like that in the oven super  easily now if you want to load up a tray  we talked about sheet pan dinners dinner  for four I&amp;#39;m one of my little little  pans here I&amp;#39;ve got a little marinade  made from soy some ginger you go ahead  what kind of pans can I can I use a  glass pan in there can you get a little  pan okay and then of course we have the  bakeware coming up and then of course my  dura bake that goes in beautifully a few  sesame seeds over the top of that  beautiful salmon and then that whole  thing goes straight on into the oven  gorgeous 350 degrees on bake away you go  so there&amp;#39;s nothing more to do you know  you you preset it and then you don&amp;#39;t  have to think again if you want to set a  timer you can if you don&amp;#39;t want to you  don&amp;#39;t have to back to the rotisserie  Alice this by far is my favorite part of  the entire oven so you see this  beautiful prime rib here let me go ahead  and get him out of there look at this  gorgeous piece of beef  look at look at the crust on that look  at the caramel is Asian what do they  call that bark on there I mean I&amp;#39;m  telling you you&amp;#39;ve got to try this oven  to see how this cooks it&amp;#39;s not just  convection it&amp;#39;s not just for tits or  just things defrost this thing does  everything right down to slow cook a  slow cook function in an oven that is  that perfect size when I say you know  2.6 liters I want to give you a  dimensions while your carve incredible  look at that we&amp;#39;ve got this beautiful  roast beef I mean how good does that  look  so it probably coulda used a little bit  longer in the oven but that&amp;#39;s okay let  me show you this ours well just have a  taste of the outside because that is why  your eat or I&amp;#39;m so sorry okay  that&amp;#39;s why your cooking on the writes  history because you want that beef that  beautiful outside  it&amp;#39;s just crazy you will never get that  in a traditional oven never will you get  that bark never will you get that  caramelization that crisp eNOS you won&amp;#39;t  get it that&amp;#39;s why we love rotisserie so  much but most of us we&amp;#39;re not gonna pay  a lot of money for rotisserie and we&amp;#39;re  not gonna buy money for for something  just one thing is everything does  everything that I can&amp;#39;t afford in my  absolutely the baking now I&amp;#39;m pulling  these have to show you the size of the  pan I mean that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve got a big  hand and that&amp;#39;s a big pan that&amp;#39;s a big  nice deep pan also the mac and cheese  works beautifully in there if you want  to do something super simple like make a  grilled cheese sandwich well you can do  that too this is some of that turkey  breast that we sous-vide earlier so  thank you very much so I&amp;#39;m gonna go  ahead and put that on right so then I  like a lots of Swiss cheese now I would  choose the broiling ssin for this again  if you wanted to choose the roast and  set it up really high you could you know  there&amp;#39;s lots of ways to to do this but  I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and stick this on  right you get this rack as well which is  your multi-purpose rack correct it&amp;#39;s  going to come with it as well so you get  again the oven rack which is traditional  and then you get that multipurpose rack  so you&amp;#39;re gonna be able to do everything  from your pizzas to your your lasagna is  in there look at everything we&amp;#39;ve done  so far  pulled pork mac and cheese we baked in  here we wrote us read in there we&amp;#39;ve  made lasagna we have made the most  amazing pizza with the most perfect  crust so there you can see where we  started the rotisserie yeah look at the  pizza crust on this I&amp;#39;m just gonna pull  that up that is why you buy woodfire  pizza ovens because it puts that kind of  crust on it we&amp;#39;ve done lasagnas that are  just creamy and pull that out we baked  it oh I shouldn&amp;#39;t attach that I baked it  mac and cheese  pulled pork we slow-cooked in that oven  I&amp;#39;ve never ever seen anything this is  the pizza that I made right at the top  of the  at the show which was what all of 12  minutes ago I think and have a listen to  this yeah beautiful crust you can be  cooking homemade pizzas in a minute it  does a fantastic job of frozen pizzas of  course but if you want to make your own  then I encourage you to because I tell  you what your family will thank you for  it I will thank you for it because you  know I love it when people get  adventurous in the kitchen and sometimes  it&amp;#39;s nice see how I&amp;#39;m cutting this a  little differently and obviously this is  with our pizza cutter and even this  thick thick crust that we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve gone  ahead and made here is no match for us  so there you go you&amp;#39;ve got this  beautiful pizza in just seconds what do  you think it&amp;#39;s a crust okay  that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all about when it comes  to pizza it&amp;#39;s about the crust okay I&amp;#39;m  just gonna and then there&amp;#39;s the nachos  and you know in a minute well actually  in probably less than a minute football  season starting oh yeah I&amp;#39;m sure the  fall sports are gonna be here and you&amp;#39;re  gonna be able isn&amp;#39;t that so fabulous you  really can you can hear your food which  is a beautiful thing I&amp;#39;m gonna throw  these nachos in there natural actually  you don&amp;#39;t want to put on to higher  temperature because you want that cheese  to melt kind of slow so let me start by  choosing bake and then I&amp;#39;m gonna go  ahead and choose my temperature I&amp;#39;m  going to turn it down to maybe 250 so  I&amp;#39;m going to start really quite low okay  now before I pop this on broil and I  said that that would happen quite  quickly look that infrared light oh  that&amp;#39;s not if you can feel that heat so  you can see that she&amp;#39;s already starting  to melt and that  was starting from an off position so but  you see that infrared light that also  comes on when you&amp;#39;re baking why do I  care about infrared heating because it  gives you extra crispness  especially that&amp;#39;s why we put it in here  because we wanted to get that crisp skin  on chicken anything that we&amp;#39;re going to  rotisserie and it also gives you  beautiful crispy pieces on the cheese as  well with you isn&amp;#39;t that so good so  again you know I mentioned before even  if you&amp;#39;re just reheating frozen foods  like this guess what it works really  beautifully well you know you&amp;#39;re able to  keep things very crisp here that yeah  you know deep fried mozzarella it keeps  it all just perfect for you you could  doing bacon another one that&amp;#39;s great you  know you can just lay some bacon over  the pan and bake that in and talk about  crispy crunchy pizza over here so  beautiful  listen this is your time to get  something home that&amp;#39;s going to work for  you in so many different ways because  you&amp;#39;re gonna get up in the morning  you&amp;#39;re gonna make your toast in here  you&amp;#39;re gonna make your salmon in here  you&amp;#39;re gonna make your grilled cheese in  here your lasagnas your pizzas you&amp;#39;re  gonna do a rotisserie  you&amp;#39;re gonna defrost your roast in here  you&amp;#39;re gonna slow-cook your pulled pork  in here right all of it  salmon and broccolini you know you can  see it and don&amp;#39;t forget guys these  little pans three-piece bakeware coming  right up where we&amp;#39;ve got that coming  your way in minutes but you might want  to get it now because it&amp;#39;s getting  really really limited so let me give you  a quick update okay which is 14 and 3/4  of an inch in terms of your length 19  and a quarter of an inch in terms of  your width and 11 inches in terms of  your height it takes up a small space  but the capacity of this is fabulous  you&amp;#39;re looking at what is this - its 26  liter 26 litres of space in there so you  saw that huge lasagna come out though if  it&amp;#39;s a whole pizza and I think that&amp;#39;s a  14 inch pizza you&amp;#39;re looking at do you  know how big the chicken was how many  okay nearly a four and a half pounds of  chicken rotisserie din there you could  put a duck in there kind of crispy duck  would be fabulous in there and then  because it&amp;#39;s convection your cooking  your desserts better you&amp;#39;re going even  better than ever  these little free from pies and again it  costs with the dura bake it&amp;#39;s really the  perfect companion to this up of this  little three piece all three pieces fit  inside the oven and it just makes such a  difference  freeform pies so we just will roll out  the dough throw in the fruits wrap up  the edges and you get I mean let me let  me just shut you yeah let me just show  it to you you know I mean have a look at  that that&amp;#39;s nectarines and raspberries  and it doesn&amp;#39;t get much better than that  with a dollop of creme warts or creme  fraiche so delicious absolutely  beautiful we have a limited quantity on  these if you&amp;#39;re interested in it it&amp;#39;s a  great time for you to really think about  getting something home that&amp;#39;s gonna work  for you right now when you don&amp;#39;t want to  use your big oven and do all that it  gives you more functions than a  traditional oven because it has the  convection it has the rotisserie and it  has the ability to defrost it have the  ability to slowly cook does your oven  slow cook I mean just as a function  that&amp;#39;s insane and it&amp;#39;s one 29.95 5  flexpayments on it of $25.99 as well and  something that&amp;#39;s going to work back  beautifully with that is</text><text start="2.159" dur="6.511"></text><text start="5.4" dur="4.89"></text><text start="8.67" dur="3.75"></text><text start="10.29"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.06" dur="15.49">[Music]  so one of the things that the  electric-fence does not come with is a  grounding rod and that looks like this  this they have two different types they  have a galvanized type and then they  have a copper type this one here is  about a half-inch diameter it&amp;#39;s about  ten foot long depending on your location  and probably the moisture in the ground  and what&amp;#39;s in your ground they recommend  going anywhere from 3 feet to 6 feet in  the ground so what that means is they  want you to pound this guy 3 to 6 feet  into the ground if anyone&amp;#39;s ever pound a  stake into the ground when you&amp;#39;ve been  camping and you&amp;#39;re just trying to pound  a stake 6 inches in the ground you can&amp;#39;t  do it that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m worried about  on this pounding this 3 feet into the  ground I suppose once I if I don&amp;#39;t hit  major rocks I would think after the  first sediment layer if I get past all  the rocks and maybe I can do okay the  other thing that I feel that you really  need in order to pound this in the  ground it&amp;#39;s a hammer isn&amp;#39;t gonna do it  if you have a hammer just hammer in the  very end of this it&amp;#39;s not going to  happen there&amp;#39;s two ways of doing it I&amp;#39;m  going to show you one of two ways and  that is with a piledriver and it&amp;#39;s  basically a pipe that has handles on it  I actually have one but I don&amp;#39;t have it  here right now but anyway it&amp;#39;s a  piledriver  it&amp;#39;s a pipe with the handles on it and  you basically set over the top of this  and you just keep pounding this pole  into the ground with this pipe that&amp;#39;s  over top of the end of it what I&amp;#39;ve done  which I&amp;#39;m going to try I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s  gonna work I had this for my well pump  to pull the to pull the piping from the  well on the bottom it screws in and to  the well and that&amp;#39;s what allowed  pull my plumbing up from my well so I  thought well this would fit really good  over the top of this only thing I&amp;#39;m  worried about this is a galvanized  cast-iron t fitting up here and I think  there&amp;#39;s a good possibility then I&amp;#39;m  gonna bust that T fitting and crack it  and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not gonna work but what&amp;#39;s  nice about this is it&amp;#39;s nice and long so  I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it bending  this rod until I get it about three feet  into the ground so I&amp;#39;m gonna give it a  try and see how that works and the other  thing is my fence is gonna just wrapping  around here and it&amp;#39;s gonna come over and  come about two inches away from this  corner of the chicken mansion here they  don&amp;#39;t want it to touch because the wires  the bare wires that are in the fence it  doesn&amp;#39;t want you to grounding to they  you know any material like wood or trees  so I need to leave a little bit of space  I&amp;#39;ll probably put some non conductive  plastic to fill that space but I just  don&amp;#39;t want it to touch the wood which  has moisture and stuff in it so my  electrical panel when I run wire wiring  out to the chicken coop will be on this  side here so I&amp;#39;ll have a ground wire  they&amp;#39;ll run out from my electrical panel  down and clamp on to this grounding rod  that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;ll be in the ground so I&amp;#39;m  gonna hook this up and we&amp;#39;ll see if I  can pound this sucker into the ground  [Music]  chicken there&amp;#39;s a chicken right here  little chicken I&amp;#39;m gonna put this  running you&amp;#39;re gonna get spiked started  right up there right up there is the end  of it and yes I need a ladder  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  well so I was off to a good start but it  was did exactly what I thought it was  gonna do busted right through the top of  the tee I know it&amp;#39;s just cast iron so it  wasn&amp;#39;t gonna hold up but hey I got it  down about four four feet into the  ground so that&amp;#39;s pretty good and so I&amp;#39;m  gonna go grab the other piledriver show  you what that looks like and we&amp;#39;ll  finish this off with the with that other  one  all right so I&amp;#39;m back this is a  piledriver is or at least that&amp;#39;s what I  call it maybe it&amp;#39;s not even called a  piledriver  but it&amp;#39;s got the hole in one end got a  heavy metal cap on it and you do just  like I was doing with that pipe there  mostly for those metal steak poles that  you pound in the ground and you just put  this over the top of it and you just let  it&amp;#39;s pretty heavy and the weight alone  just dropping it will just keep pounding  your stakes into the ground so I&amp;#39;m going  to remove my my rig there and try using  this to pound it as far as it can go  [Music]  [Music]  all right that&amp;#39;s work out so I have it  let&amp;#39;s see it was 10 foot long and have  about five feet in so that&amp;#39;s pretty good  they say three to six feet so if I&amp;#39;m  five feet it&amp;#39;s good enough all right now  cut it off now cut it off at the ground  [Music]  Oh  [Applause]  never fails you got the grounding rod  clamp  so that&amp;#39;s for the wire go from there  up to the grounding terminal pretty  simple  [Music]  next what they also don&amp;#39;t have in the  premium electric fence is they don&amp;#39;t  have the grounding rod clamp and they I  don&amp;#39;t have a lightning arrester but  their directions say that they recommend  it the Lightning arrestor basically if  your fence gets struck by lightning and  the surge comes through instead of the  electrical current from the Lightning  going up and in to where your controller  is at it goes through here and goes down  to the path of least resistance and down  to the grounding rod  [Music]  you  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  all right back to the fence last night I  was working on the wiring for the  grounding rod and and all of that and it  was having trouble figuring out I did  the the Lightning protector thing wasn&amp;#39;t  making a whole lot of sense to me and so  I went back and did some research on how  that&amp;#39;s supposed to be wired up and it&amp;#39;s  according to the premier electric fence  company their directions say you should  have a separate grounding rod that goes  from the Lightning arrestor to the  grounding rod and then on the other side  of the Lightning arrestor it goes up to  the to the actual hot wire of the fence  so that way if lightning strikes the hot  wire which is what all the wires are on  the premium fence they&amp;#39;re all hot then  the lightning will then go down to the  least path of a resistance which is  through the Lightning arrestor and found  and into the end of the ground here  I&amp;#39;m not after thinking about it I&amp;#39;m not  too concerned about lightning for a  couple reasons  we&amp;#39;ve up here in the Pacific Northwest  and there hasn&amp;#39;t been a whole lot of  lightning storms in the area and as you  can see behind me is my chicken coop but  it&amp;#39;s nestled in a bunch of trees so I  guess it&amp;#39;s possible for the Lightning to  go down through past the trees and hit  this little fences here but I doubt it  that could be wrong  I&amp;#39;m just guessing that man really so I  think I&amp;#39;m not sure what I&amp;#39;m gonna do yet  so for now I think I&amp;#39;m going to bypass  the lightning arrester and I&amp;#39;ll probably  work it back in but I just want to get  the fence up and running right now and  then I&amp;#39;ll go back and look at that again  but I think that&amp;#39;s it so okay I got one  issue here that I got to deal with right  now and that&amp;#39;s um I have a tree that is  right of the way let me show you what  I&amp;#39;m talking about  you</text><text start="19.61" dur="4.33"></text><text start="21.69"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="28.189" dur="5.951">hey David survival tips and I was  walking around blade show and I found  Stephen here Tablas there&amp;#39;s no push  tools I&amp;#39;m really excited  it takes a lot to give me goosebumps  about a knife but he was showing me his  Bush tool and this may be the ultimate  wilderness survival blade so Stephen can  you show the guys that Bushmen  absolutely and I&amp;#39;ll start by saying that  the reason that we decided to call it  the bush tool instead of the bush blade  or bush knife is because it&amp;#39;s more than  just enough it incorporates features  that allow you to do multiple things  that would be really beneficial in the  permit of skills mindset the real idea  behind ax was to make a single tool that  could do a lot of those skills but not  become clunky and overburdened with  different features that might get in the  way of other things basically I wanted  to do a basic traditional shape knob we  did want the chopping ability of a  tomahawk or a small hatchet so we did do  a curve cutting edge on it that gives  you better bite when you chop into a  tree also it will give you  better performance when cutting meat our  vegetation it is what I call a pseudo  scandi we do a stand atop ground and  then come back and put a secondary bevel  that not only makes it a more durable  edge what makes it easier for filth  maintenance correct that&amp;#39;s what you need  you need a sharp edge but you get a  strong edge for exactly that will last  and we do our charter for hours at a  twenty seven degree angle okay it&amp;#39;s a  good utility angle you can skin a deer  with it chopped plants work with rope  it&amp;#39;ll cut really anything you can throw  at it  the idea behind that was there again  we&amp;#39;ve got the curve cutting edge we did  do a spear point tossed point that is in  line with the handle so that if you&amp;#39;re  boring a hole to start a fire board or  if you just need to cut a small hole out  of a piece of wood maybe to make a flute  or something to entertain so thinking  about that exactly it is a spear top  point so there again you can use it to  stab if you needed to get behind a piece  of bark to work it off of a tree that  gives you some actual power to get  behind it so you have the  you have the point of a sphere but you  have the strength of like a droplet  exactly very utilitarian blade shape and  that&amp;#39;s basically what I did was take  features of knives are really alive but  then I totally mix them together to that  point what I&amp;#39;m calling the anvil here is  used for when you&amp;#39;re using a hammer  stick to baton through a piece of wood  foot points all knobs are excellent at  batana because of that clip but yet  they&amp;#39;re weak at the tip so what I did  was basically overlaid that profile to  give the anvil so now you get all that  directed force it also gives you a place  to get a secondary handhold if you&amp;#39;re  gonna be scraping or if you&amp;#39;re gonna do  real fun work you can even choke up here  and have somewhere for your hand to lock  into where it doesn&amp;#39;t slide out you&amp;#39;ve  got I mean you&amp;#39;re going almost out to  the tip was the same width of your of  your spine let&amp;#39;s just turn it that way  so  so you have that almost the full width  right out to the point on spine which  makes  the back edge we&amp;#39;ve left squared off so  that it can be used as a square edge  scraper if you ever needed to finish out  the back of a bow or anything like that  where you need to do some fine finish  briefing our fire rod not tear this has  to fit our 5/16  so there were your fire rod to Emily the  wheat co.design that with EXO tack  industries but the knot will hit the rod  in three different areas instead of just  a single point of contact and also it  catches the sparks here and throws them  in a straight point where it makes sure  that it hits it on your tender thank you  also this will work to scrape down the  hardwood floor shafts of an arrow that  way you can round one out make sure that  it&amp;#39;s not gonna wobble and I keep I  remember at the back of the blade here  that dead ends into a integrated guard  so you&amp;#39;re not gonna have to worry about  sliding up on the different getting  aggressive with it the nice point about  that is it allows you to use it in a  chef setting where you could do food  prep fun chop tender in order to get a  better chance of catching us far and  really this top edge is easier to  sharpen also because you don&amp;#39;t have a  dead end that you&amp;#39;re trying to start  from  so you can fully use this edge and if  you ever do wear it to the point where  it gets difficult to sharpen you can do  a traditional scandi style sharpen where  you lay it flat on the stone reestablish  that put your secondary bevel back on  and you can keep going till you&amp;#39;re out  of metal  we did a g10 handle g10 is one the most  durable materials out there in my  opinion it&amp;#39;s also one of the most  beautiful and it we give a lifetime  guarantee I actually thought that was  such a nice job thank you very much  great material for us we put two found  holes in it that allows you to either  attach a stick to make it a longer  chopping tool where you could use it  like a small axe or you could also add  an L shape stick to it where you can use  it as a soft to gather grass or tall  weeds in order to make shelter cordage  anything that you need long fibers for  it is a hatchet shaped handle so you can  get different grips on it to increase or  decrease your control and power did an  extended pommel on it so that you can  use it to pound on things they&amp;#39;re  getting breaking up Bart breaking up  fibers left the edge event slightly  so that you can use it to scrape out  spoon or bowls around that end you left  it exactly it&amp;#39;s not sharp but it does  have a little bit yeah it can get some  bite yeah sooner oh and I&amp;#39;m going to  take you to come up with this from the  first version of it to production  version about two years of sketches and  making life out of cardboard knives  wooden house switching him to steal but  you weren&amp;#39;t done into it you were happy  there were two of them that I evaluated  for over six months before I ever made  it production okay  so it truly became my perfect knife  before I offered it to anyone  sorry I interrupted you know you&amp;#39;re fun  absolutely exciting again it&amp;#39;s a 3/16  inch thick steel and it has a large flat  here so you could use it to bust open  nuts if you&amp;#39;re setting a tent you can  set tent pegs and that&amp;#39;s I mean the  balance of this is really it&amp;#39;s got a  nice balance and it does have that mass  right even though it&amp;#39;s a large blade the  balance point is half an inch in front  of that tube so it&amp;#39;s right where the  handle is so you don&amp;#39;t feel tip heavy or  it feels neutral in the hand and it is  1095 high carbon steel professionally  heat treated to a rockwell of 57 every  blades tested there crowd treated twice  so they&amp;#39;re tougher we do a phosphorus  gun blue finish to help discourage rust  since it is a carbon steel product that  can rust  that with proper Karen will just develop  a nice natural patina and become even  more individualized to the person who  owns it patina is a basically a  beautiful rust it&amp;#39;s when the surface of  the steel will oxidize but not truly  rust and it develops a character of its  own it&amp;#39;s kind of sometimes they&amp;#39;re shiny  sometimes they&amp;#39;re a lot Brown but it&amp;#39;s a  natural protection as long as the patina  is on there you won&amp;#39;t have any rusting  and go further into the metal it has  developed from acids in the plant  teacher cutting and also the fats and  meats that

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="7.61" dur="4.12">hey everyone so in this tutorial I&amp;#39;m  going to show you how you can make your  very own headband and you can also use  this technique to knit a circle scar  we should consume it to start we&amp;#39;re  gonna tie a double knot around one of  the knitting needles and typically  you&amp;#39;re supposed to use a slip knot but I  found it easier to demonstrate I&amp;#39;m gonna  explain this in greater detail later but  with this knot we&amp;#39;re actually not going  to knit it we&amp;#39;re just gonna pull it  right through the needle when we get to  it so now we&amp;#39;re gonna cast on and we do  this by wrapping the yarn once clockwise  around the finger and then slipping it  on to the needle and this creates a  stitch so for the headband you&amp;#39;re gonna  want to create about 13 stitches and if  you want to create an infinity scarf  you&amp;#39;re going to want to have about 30 to  40 stitches so the more stitches you  have the wider your headband will be or  the wider your scarf will be in terms of  times I laughs extremely elastic  so you&amp;#39;re gonna be holding the needle  with the stitches in your left hand then  you&amp;#39;re gonna take the right needle and  slip it under the left needle and then  you&amp;#39;re gonna take the yarn and wrap it  over the right needle so it&amp;#39;s in between  both needles and then you&amp;#39;re gonna tuck  it underneath the stitch and then bring  it over so you create a new stitch on  the right needles so we&amp;#39;re gonna  continue this step until there are no  longer any more stitches on the Left  needle and remember the beginning how we  used a double knot instead of a slipknot  but every other time every single stitch  they&amp;#39;re shooting a song in a very target  the second assault operative room  tomorrow the songs of the session enough  you know Jesus  chassé  so now we&amp;#39;re gonna measure the band  around the circumference of our heads  and make it about two inches smaller  because it&amp;#39;ll stretch once you&amp;#39;ve  achieved your desired length you want to  cast off and this is the process of  basically closing off every stitch and  you do this by knitting the first two  stitches on your left needle once you&amp;#39;ve  done that you&amp;#39;re gonna grab the bottom  stitch on the right needle then pull it  over the top stitch and then drop it  you&amp;#39;re going to continue this process  until you have no more stitches on the  Left needle  this year my team FC tear seller now you  want to loosen the last stitch and pull  out the needle and then cut about four  inches of yarn and you&amp;#39;re gonna want to  pull this yarn through that last stitch  to create a knot and secure it  cut off the excess pieces of yarn the  final thing you want to do is the red  your needle and typically I&amp;#39;ll go for a  color that&amp;#39;s the same as the color of  the yarn I use for the headband but  black is all I had at home so you&amp;#39;re  gonna want to put the two end pieces  together and then just start sewing you  may want to do this process twice is  really really secure and we&amp;#39;re done  thank you so much for watching I really  appreciate it and I hope you enjoyed  this tutorial  recessions office usage</text><text start="10.559"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.24" dur="4.8">hi guys welcome to diy ideas so today i  wanted to show you how you can make your  own flower red but i&amp;#39;m not gonna do one  that goes around your head like they  usually do i wanted to do a decorative  red so for that occasion i found some  artificial flowers i thought it would be  a fun thing to do and it&amp;#39;s good for  spring and summer and my kind also has a  candle so let me show you how  so for this project you&amp;#39;re gonna need a  bucket or a flower pot and a candle too  then i have some artificial so plastic  flowers i got them at ikea all at once  just like a bouquet they&amp;#39;re not one  piece but are tied together so i&amp;#39;ll  separate those  um yeah in a second  and here i have some paper decorations  to tie our flowers and i also  found  um  pair of scissors that we&amp;#39;re going to use  for cutting the flowers out of the  bouquet  [Music]  [Music]  they&amp;#39;re kind of glued in there too so  we&amp;#39;ll cut them out individually  [Music]  and now we have our flowers that we can  arrange and bring together around the  bucket to get our red  [Music]  i&amp;#39;ll begin with one of the flowers so  take our paper piece and tie it around  the stem so that i can connect it with  other pieces  [Music]  oops i pulled the stem out good thing  it&amp;#39;s an artificial flower  [Music]  this ends so where the spool still is  i&amp;#39;ll connect with other flowers to make  a circle shape  [Music]  so as you can see i&amp;#39;m going really tight  with this  [Music]  [Music]  so i came to an end of my first stem so  we need another flower now  and now the same deal again  [Music]  nice and firm so i already have three  pieces and the cool thing is that it&amp;#39;s  flexible so you can put it on the bucket  or your flower pot and arrange some more  so let&amp;#39;s keep going  [Music]  [Music]  do  do  [Music]  [Music]  and here at the end i&amp;#39;ll cut the paper  off leave a bit over and tie knot  [Music]  [Music]  and here we are now this is our end  result and i actually have to say i love  the color combination it looks really  fresh and alive  and now we tie it around the bucket  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  a bow tie works best  and i hope you guys like it as much as i  do so this is our end result if you did  like it feel free to shoot a thumbs up  you can also subscribe to our channel  and check out other videos that we have  and also stay tuned for new videos we&amp;#39;re  gonna post soon  so yeah

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="5.7">hello I&amp;#39;m Matt and welcome back to DIY  perks in this video I&amp;#39;m going to be  showing you how to build your very own  homemade projector and get this it&amp;#39;s or  Kay you heard that right it&amp;#39;s 4k this is  going to be a good one  despite being homemade this projector  packs a serious punch with a sharp  contrast the image and vibrant colors is  also fully Android enabled so can  operate on its own without it being  plugged into anything making it  brilliant for Qing online content with  friends and family now later on I will  be comparing the image quality to an  off-the-shelf cinema projector that  costs $2,000 and believe me it&amp;#39;s a bit  shocking so stay tuned for that but  before we actually begin the build  process I want to show you the  fundamentals of how projectors works to  the yet a base level understanding of it  for this explainer I&amp;#39;m going to project  a slide image which is basically a small  transparent photograph when it&amp;#39;s placed  in front of a light source all it does  is cast vague blurry colors so it needs  to be brought into focus by a lens here  though you might be surprised to see  that the result is a single bright spot  in the middle this is because the lens  is only seeing a single bright point of  light so the rest of the image remains  dark as a result to understand exactly  what&amp;#39;s going on here we need to plot out  the rays of light so our basic projector  setup so far consists of a projection  lens an image and a light source all the  light rays are radiating out from this  light source with no direction Aarthi so  the Rays that actually hit the back of  the projection lens are the ones that  have only passed through in the middle  of the image to rectify this and keep  the light source close by projectors use  an additional lens between the light  source and the image setup to collimate  the light rays to make them parallel and  this results in the full image now being  projected efficiency can be increased  further with the addition of a  converging lens which directs the  parallel rays straight towards the back  of the projection lens making the  projection even brighter so hopefully  you understand the basic theory behind  how projectors work and I think it&amp;#39;s  about time we get to building ours  taking a look at the inside you can see  that it&amp;#39;s essentially made of different  layers all supported by four threaded  rods to allow for accurate positioning  during construction to make the layers  themselves I suggest using aluminium as  it&amp;#39;s cheap strong and easy to work with  each layer has to be a 20 centimeter  square with a hole in each corner for  the threaded rods to fit through now  these also need various holes and  cutouts made in them throughout the  build depending on what components they  support but I&amp;#39;ll cover this as we go  along so to start the frame off we&amp;#39;re  going to make the base layer and as this  will be externally visible I&amp;#39;m going to  add some mats black vinyl wrap to it as  it&amp;#39;s quicker than painting and gives a  good overall finish we can now take one  of the rods and thread a pillar spacer  onto it followed by the new black layer  clamping it in place with a capped  doughnut the spacing provided by the  pillars needs to add about four  centimetres so you may need to add a few  of them to achieve this  anyway once all four threaded rods have  been clamped in place you can see that  the dome knots function as feet to  address the rods wobbling around though  we can add the first additional layer  which can again be clamped in place with  some nuts the space between these layers  will be used to house various power  wires so it needs a hole made in it for  these wires to pass through later so  with the internal frame now started it&amp;#39;s  ready to be built upon and the first  components we&amp;#39;re going to add is the  light source for this we&amp;#39;ll need a 100  watt LED a heat sink and the power board  links to all of which can find in this  video&amp;#39;s description as we want the  projector to have vivid and vibrant  colors I recommend choosing an an LED  with a high color rendering index or CRI  this does mean that you&amp;#39;ll be spending a  bit more on it but it&amp;#39;s money well spent  as it directly affects the final image  in a significant way one thing to  consider when you choose yours is its  diameter however as this will affect  your lens choice I&amp;#39;ll be going into this  in detail later but for now just take it  that the larger the LEDs surface area  the wider the aperture opening on the  lens has to be either way as the LEDs  are so bright they do get very hot which  is what the heatsink is for using a CPU  cooler from a computer is ideal for this  and old ones can be found online quite  cheaply its size might lead some to  think that it&amp;#39;s overkill for this use  case but it&amp;#39;s actually ideal as it will  mean that the final projector will  operate more quietly due to the  additional cooling Headroom provided by  the large cooler allowing for slower  spinning fans so to mount this heatsink  we can place it on top of the base and  thread four knots onto the rods so that  they match the heat sinks height these  are for supporting a new layer with more  nuts being used to tightly clamp it in  place  as you can see on this new layer I&amp;#39;ve  already added a hole for the LED to see  out through and a vent slot along one  edge this slot is the start of the  airflow cooling path that will allow air  to pass through the entire projector  keeping it cool it is an essential step  and every layer needs one of these vents  anyway once the LED has some wires  soldered to it it should be able to fit  nicely into its hole the heatsink can  then have a small dot of thermal  compound added to its center and then be  clamped against the LED resulting in  both components being held securely in  place the LED can now be hooked up to  its power board which is in fact a  voltage booster before this gets hooked  up though you need to adjust it to the  correct values for your specific LED and  you can find an entire video on how to  do this on the DIY perks extra channel a  link to it you can find in this video&amp;#39;s  description a good place to mount this  power board by the way is underneath the  heat sinks base as it can make contact  with the heatsink here and take  advantage of its cooling ability so with  that done and working it&amp;#39;s time to take  control over these light rays and quite  literally bend them to our will our goal  here is if you remember to take the  radiating light rays and first make them  parallel and then direct them to where  the projection lens will be later  instead of using large expensive glass  lenses for these we&amp;#39;re going to use what  are known as Fornell lenses which are  basically flat lenses that slice up the  required curvature to achieve a much  thinner and cheaper lens and they&amp;#39;re  usually made out of plastic they can be  bought as a set specifically for DIY  projector projects like this and I&amp;#39;ve  put a link to some in this video&amp;#39;s  description each one needs to be fitted  onto its own layer and again don&amp;#39;t  forget the vent slots now I&amp;#39;ve made one  of mine black to differentiate it during  this video so the silver one is going to  act as the collimator lens which makes  the Rays parallel while the black one is  going to act as the converging lens so  the silver collimator lens needs to be  mounted in place first with its foreign  Eldridge&amp;#39;s facing up  to achieve collimation it does need to  be precisely positioned above the LED at  its specified focal length which for  mine is 90 millimeters if you don&amp;#39;t know  the exact focal length of yours or you  want to make sure that it is absolutely  precise and accurate a good way of  taking this measurement can be done  before the LED got mounted in place by  doing a reverse preview of the system to  do this place a scrap piece of aluminium  where the LED goes to provide a surface  to focus on and then tilt the whole  thing towards the Sun our most distant  light source now this is going to get  very bright so never look directly at  the focused point instead use a pin to  poke a tiny hole through a piece of  electrical tape and then stick this over  your smartphone&amp;#39;s camera to block most  of the light so that you don&amp;#39;t damage  its sensor you can then preview what  you&amp;#39;re doing on the screen without ever  looking directly at the light yourself  the goal here is to adjust the  positioning of the lens so that it  projects the Sun into a single tiny dot  when you&amp;#39;re satisfied take the  measurement of this new position and  note it down as this is the lenses true  focal length now just to prove that this  is a very intense point of light this  dry stick spontaneously combusts when it  touches the focal point yikes anyway  once it&amp;#39;s all in place you can tell that  it is in fact working as a collimator  because the LED which is at its focal  point doesn&amp;#39;t appear to change in size  when you move closer to it pretty wild  it&amp;#39;s essentially been pinned at infinity  and it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re looking out at it  through a window when the LED is lit up  it affects shadows in a similar way they  don&amp;#39;t change in size like you would  expect from a local light source it just  goes between blurry and sharp anyway  after adding some pillar spaces the next  lens can be slipped down but this time  with its smooth side facing upwards in  this configuration it takes the parallel  light rays and condenses them down to a  single point where the projection lens  will be later for now though is time to  work on the focusing system  the way we&amp;#39;re going to adjust focus is  by moving the image layer forwards and  backwards and this changes the distance  between it and the projection lens  allowing us to keep the projected image  crisp and sharp this movement is going  to be achieved by taking advantage of  the threaded rods allowing for very fine  adjustment to focus to start this off  we&amp;#39;ll need a layer with a large cutout  in the middle for light to pass through  unobstructed along with you guessed it a  vent slot we need to screw a few small  pillar supports onto this layer first  though as it&amp;#39;s part one of two and it  also needs to have a piece of clear  acrylic added over the cutout so that  air is prevented from passing through it  and instead has to go through the  provided vent slot so to get each corner  of this platform to rise and fall in  unison we&amp;#39;re going to utilize a set of  four gt2 timing belt pulleys but as you  can see they don&amp;#39;t bite the rods so we  need to add some threads to them an easy  way of doing this is to get some  threaded inserts and it&amp;#39;s oh well  they&amp;#39;re slightly too large so a quick  spin in a drill with a file trims and  down to size and then they can be  clamped in place with the grub screws  nice these can now be screwed down in  place and to make them more synchronized  we can use a gt2 timing belt the two  idler pulleys you see here help to keep  it nice and tight over a fifth pulley  which has a knob attached this keeps  them all successfully synchronized so  once the second part is added it will  rise and fall evenly and reliably this  second part is actually the most  exciting part of the build as it is in  fact the vitally important image source  now in my demonstration earlier I used  this little slide image and as it&amp;#39;s  transparent light can just shine through  it to be projected by the lens but  obviously we want to watch video so we  need some kind of screen that light can  shine through and you know what works  for that a small LCD panel with its  backlight removed small LCDs like this  are used in smartphones and you can buy  them off eBay along with a control board  that adds an HDMI input making it a high  pixel density mini monitor you can of  course find links to these in the  description and they&amp;#39;re really not that  expensive even for a 2560 by 1440 pixel  panel that will provide a superbly sharp  projected image and will be certainly  good enough for most use cases so is my  recommendation however this being the  debut of this particular projector  design I want it to be something  extra-special and the headline feature  I&amp;#39;m going for is 4k now as you can  imagine 4k screens of this size are not  at all common but they do exist  you see way back in 2015 Sony released a  phone called the Xperia z5 premium and  it featured rather ridiculously a 4k  screen now 4k at this screen size is  just absolutely wasted because you can&amp;#39;t  see any benefit of it but because we&amp;#39;re  going to be blowing it up by about a  thousand times we should see some  serious improvements take a look at this  macro image for example it&amp;#39;s a close-up  of a 1080p smartphone screen and we can  see the individual pixels compared to  the 4k Sony screen however you can see  that there&amp;#39;s a monumental difference so  it&amp;#39;s going to be interesting to see  whether we can retain this detail in the  final projected image so stay tuned for  some in-depth tests later my particular  phone has a smashed back so was actually  a very cheap eBay Buy it is worth noting  though that this remarkable 4k panel  does now appear to be available  separately on eBay with an HDMI control  board though it is rather expensive I&amp;#39;ve  put a link to it in the description if  any of you are interested however anyway  if you too  to use a phone too even if it&amp;#39;s just to  keep costs low by using an old one that  you have lying around you need to make  sure that one it actually uses an LCD  panel rather than something like an O  LED which wouldn&amp;#39;t work for this job and  two it has to have USB OTG support so  that you can plug in a mouse and  keyboard to operate it remotely once  it&amp;#39;s all boxed in with those check boxes  checked the first thing to do is  dismantle the phone far enough to reach  the display online phone fixing guides  are great for this and it&amp;#39;s not terribly  difficult so with the body and screen  now separated we can mount the body to  one of the layers using some right angle  brackets as you can see I&amp;#39;ve replaced  the battery with a small voltage  step-down board set to 4.2 volts and  added an accompanying one farad  capacitor which helps with any power  demand spikes I decided to do this  because my particular phone doesn&amp;#39;t  allow for the battery to be charged when  USB OTG is in use so emulating an  infinite battery is the only option I  have if you went with an HDMI control  board display instead of recycling a  smart phone if would likely have to be  mounted here in a similar way for both  screen types though we need to remove  the backlight system entirely which  usually involves just lifting the  various layers out and delicately  disconnecting the backlight strip to  stop it from illuminating don&amp;#39;t be  tempted to peel off the reflective layer  that stuck to the back of the screen  though as this is the polarizing layer  and the screen just wouldn&amp;#39;t display  anything if it wasn&amp;#39;t there with the  various layers removed you can now see  that it&amp;#39;s basically transparent meaning  that it&amp;#39;s ready to be mounted onto its  layer I recommend using tape told it  temporarily in place for this and then  following up with some epoxy to make it  permanent it can then be slid down on  top of the focusing platform and screwed  to its pillar supports this now makes  the gt2 pullies captive  so that adjusting the knob results in  there very even and precise rise and  fall it&amp;#39;s worth noting that this system  is entirely internal which makes the  build simpler overall notice to how the  front of this layer is black which is  important as this particular layer is  brought into focus by  lenz anyway with that win nearly  finished meaning that the last thing to  tackle is the all-important of  projection lands there are a few things  to consider when choosing your lens the  most important being the lens&amp;#39;s image  circle you see while you can purchase an  old full-frame SLR camera lens for next  to nothing  SLR lenses are designed to cover a 36 by  24 millimeter frame the same size in  fact of that tiny slide are used earlier  if we were to use one of these lenses in  our projector we would only see the very  center of the screen projected because  our display is so much larger than what  a full frame lens is designed to cover  so what we need is an old lens type  known as large format these were used in  old box cameras and wet plate cameras  and were designed with an image circle  that was way larger than those of  full-frame lenses this means that so  long as you use a large format camera  lens is likely to cover the entire phone  screen with ease even ancient ones have  great optical quality and are very cheap  on eBay you can as usual find the search  terms link in the description if you  need help finding them one other aspect  to consider however is its aperture the  aperture defines how much light a lens  lets through so you&amp;#39;d think that having  a wider aperture would result in a  brighter image no matter what right well  not for us because we&amp;#39;ve got the  converging lens that basically makes the  aperture irrelevant so long as the  aperture opening is physically wider  than the LED way using like I mentioned  earlier so for my LED which is tiny at  only 16 millimeters in diameter a lens  with an f9 aperture is fine and there&amp;#39;s  no loss of light if I were to use an LED  with a larger diameter it would  necessitate the need for something like  an f4 lens which means that it has a  much bigger aperture focal length is  important too as your lens needs to have  a shorter focal length than that of the  converging lens we added earlier this is  so that it can focus on the screen while  still being in the optimal position for  the converging lens once you&amp;#39;ve got your  lens it can be mounted onto its very own  layer and slid in place again the  position  of it is vital to get it to work  properly I tested mine before mounting  the image layer in place by having the  LED lit and moving the lens up and down  until there was no vignetting or color  fringing just a perfect white square I  then took note of this measurement  allowing me to now confidently slide it  right down in place at this current  stage now one thing that you might be  noticing is that everything is pointing  upwards towards the ceiling  this is just part of the projectors  design because it keeps the projectors  footprint very small and to direct the  light forwards we&amp;#39;re going to simply use  a mirror ideally this needs to be a  front surface mirror meaning that the  reflective surface is on the top rather  than behind a piece of glass this  increases image quality dramatically as  it eliminates ghosting to keep costs low  you might want to make one yourself from  a standard mirror and it&amp;#39;s actually  quite easy to do you can find a link to  a video about how to do it in the  description  either way this mirror needs to be  mounted onto his own layer and fixed to  the projector at a 45 degree angle this  mirror also corrects for the flipped  image effect that&amp;#39;s caused when light  passes through a lens which is why when  mounting the screen you can just put it  the right way up so now we&amp;#39;ve just got a  few finishing touches to make before we  can try it out these finishing touches  start with routing any power wires down  to the base for mine I extended a USB  OTG cable so that I could route the  phone&amp;#39;s USB port down to a USB hub which  will allow me to plug in various devices  for the phone to utilize like say a  keyboard or a USB Drive also at this  point you will need to add the fans  which in my case are both configured to  push air outwards from the central gap  and they too are powered through a  voltage regulator so that they can be  set to spin at a slower speed by under  vaulting them it is very important that  these funds do indeed push air outwards  like this and I&amp;#39;ll explain why in just a  minute as you can see I&amp;#39;ve also added a  power socket on the bottom lastly a  piece of plastic needs to be glued in  front of the phone so that it blocks any  light that might otherwise reflect off  it  and with that the core of the projector  is complete to box it in we just need to  make some aluminium side panels and add  some vinyl wrap to make both sides black  you&amp;#39;ll notice that there are some large  square cutouts in them and their  function is to allow air in and out you  see because the funds push air outwards  it means that internally the projector  has a slight negative pressure compared  to the atmosphere around it this means  that the air will gently pull into these  top cutouts zigzagging all the way down  keeping each component cool this is  particularly important for the screen as  it would otherwise get damaged from  overheating due to the amount of bright  light that hits it from behind to stop  dust from entering however we need to  glue some speaker fabric in place this  allows air to pass through easily enough  but does catch all the dust it is  slightly transparent however so to block  any stray light from the screen from  being visible through it I suggest  cutting out some cardboard and covering  them with vinyl wrap after which they  can be glued over the top of these vents  but with a spacing gap large enough air  to still go around them the reason for  going with cardboard here by the way is  merely to allow the phone&amp;#39;s Wi-Fi signal  to pass through which would otherwise be  blocked if we used something like  aluminium to mount these onto the  projector I suggest making a few Clips  my 3d printed mine but you could quite  easily make these out of wood another  thing I recommend is placing a piece of  acrylic over the mirror and lens section  to stop it from getting dusty too and  I&amp;#39;ve made the front grille magnetized so  that I can take it off and operate the  phone directly if ever needed once the  excess threaded rod is trimmed off and  capped off with some dome notes the  projector is complete  now before we try this out and see just  how good its image quality is it&amp;#39;s time  for a quick ad

brick all you&amp;#39;ve got to do is make  sure that it can output 120 watts and  you do this by multiplying its output  voltage by its output amperage and once  you&amp;#39;ve confirmed its going to work you  just plug it in and because I&amp;#39;ve got a  phone I need to turn it on now I&amp;#39;ve set  the light to be triggered when the phone  turns on so any moment now you should  see it light up there we go so at the  moment I actually can&amp;#39;t see the  projected image and that&amp;#39;s because the  room is so bright so I first need to  block it out I&amp;#39;m also going to adjust  the focus so it lens sharp on my screen  so with the room blacked out the first  thing I&amp;#39;m going to take a look at is  sharpness and here we&amp;#39;ve got the image I  showed you earlier with the 4k screen  versus 1080p screen test and amazingly  you can see each and every pixel which  shows you that we&amp;#39;re actually taking  advantage of the full 4k panel here even  right up to the corners which is an  attribute of the lens  now the brightness is actually just  about right for a dark room but if you  have a light on or even a window that&amp;#39;s  not covered it will completely kill the  image and this is because the LCD panel  actually does still block quite a lot of  light so it&amp;#39;s the best you can do really  with a setup like this but for most  people it should be just fine thanks to  the keyboard and mouse I can operate it  remotely as well and it&amp;#39;s a fully  fledged Android experience making it a  really cool smart projector contrast and  colors are absolutely on point too as  you can see in these images  this is all thanks to the LED we&amp;#39;re  using  now what we&amp;#39;re really interested though  is in video playback and just like  everything else it&amp;#39;s fantastic it&amp;#39;s  fully 4k with all the attributes I&amp;#39;ve  mentioned previously nice  you can even stream videos directly off  YouTube and to get good audio all you  need to do is plug in external speakers  through the phone&amp;#39;s headphone socket  that in my case I extend it to the  outside of the case so all this is  looking great so far but how does it  compare to the commercial projector that  literally costs ten times the price  let&amp;#39;s have a look the first thing worth  noting is that the expensive projector  has a much higher brightness although it  also has a lot more fan noise adjusting  the exposure settings on the camera you  can see that the overall image is very  comparable and I&amp;#39;ll let you be the judge  regarding sharpness colors however don&amp;#39;t  look as vibrant so it really shows the  importance of that LED so I think that  that performance is pretty remarkable  it&amp;#39;s hard to convey over video just how  good it looks but trust me it stacks up  to the commercial unit remarkably well  now brightness wise you might be tempted  to add a reflector to focus more of the  light from the LED towards the back of  the screen but that actually doesn&amp;#39;t  work very well and can potentially  damage the screen itself because it  reflects actually more heat towards the  screen than it does light resulting in a  very bright hot spot and this will  likely damage it so don&amp;#39;t do that  you might also be tempted to use a more  powerful LED so instead of using a  hundred watt LED you might want to use a  300 watt LED and while you could do this  it makes the project more complicated  because you need a beefier power supply  a beefier LED driver and much louder  fans because though it will need to deal  with more cooling particularly on the  back of the LCD panel so I think that  using a 100 watt LED is just about the  right balance because the brightness  resulting from it is just about right  for watching a movie at night and it&amp;#39;s  very very quiet so I would say it&amp;#39;s just  now if you do want to build one of these  yourself I will be making a PDF guide  available for it which contains all the  measurements and the tools you&amp;#39;ll need  as well as the guides for all the  different components and extra tips and  tricks as well so you can find that  linked in the description in a few weeks  so other than that I think that&amp;#39;s it for  this video it&amp;#39;s been a pretty epic  project but the result is amazing  so I hope you enjoyed it and I hope to  see you next time but bye for now</text><text start="3.75" dur="4.55"></text><text start="5.73" dur="7.409"></text><text start="8.3" dur="9.25"></text><text start="13.139"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="3.84">hey everyone its mark Wiens with  migration ology calm good morning from  Samui and I had an amazing sleep last  night it&amp;#39;s now 6:30 a.m. and this is one  of the best times to take a swim this  water is absolutely amazing it&amp;#39;s so warm  and it&amp;#39;s so peaceful and yeah just  taking a morning swim is one of the best  things to do in the ocean but it is now  almost time for breakfast so I&amp;#39;m going  to go dry off and young and I have this  thing where we always love to be first  or we always like to show up at the  breakfast buffet as soon as they open  maybe it&amp;#39;s because we love breakfast  buffets so much we&amp;#39;ve made it to the  breakfast location I remember from our  tour of the hotel yesterday and they  have some outdoor seating breakfast  buffet time  you can just ordered two fried eggs and  she was pretty happy that she made a  smiley face with her sauce pretty sure  chilli sauce got my first round of the  breakfast buffet and I decided to go  straight in for the good stuff that is  the way to start start them in a a good  day with the chilies and garlic and  little little slices of lime it just  takes the omelet to another level  oh-ho-ho that&amp;#39;s good so I&amp;#39;m going to get  a mixed fruit juice and then I have  asked her to include king and clutch I  which is finger root and ginger Cup good  mock up oh that&amp;#39;s marvelous oh I&amp;#39;m  tasting the pineapple in there but  really nicely I&amp;#39;m tasting the finger  root and the ginger we&amp;#39;re heading to  reception now and I think they want to  give us a little tour of the grounds as  well as go to the golf course which is  just a short distance away so this  resort has a golf course and I from what  I read there are some very good views of  the island and the ocean from the golf  course so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re heading  right now  this is their kind of restaurant seating  area in the front and there&amp;#39;s an amazing  view it&amp;#39;s a little bit bright right now  but you can see the ocean in the  distance and just the coast is just  covered blanketed in palm trees some we  is very famous in Thailand for their  coconut trees we jumped onto a golf cart  and we are driving around the course  some of the greens look extremely  challenging but a lot of fun  driving around the golf course in the  golf cart was amazing and relaxing and  just some beautiful views of the island  and now he and I are just taking a walk  down the street heading to a restaurant  to eat lunch we are approaching the  restaurant where we&amp;#39;re going to eat  lunch called lans aha  so it looks to be a very local popular  spot for Cal Kang which is rice and  curry and so they have a bunch of  different curries that they just serve  out of pots and a few of the dishes  we&amp;#39;re already finished and a few of them  were at the tail and so we just got what  we could but everything looks incredibly  good and they&amp;#39;re really friendly here as  well we may have ordered a little a  little over the top but I cannot wait to  dig in right now this one is called gang  guy bond and this is a curry and with  chicken a type of chicken kind of like  free-range chicken and I can see little  black specks it almost looks like pepper  and this just looks beautifully  flavorful let me put some of that onto  my rice  that sauce is so rich and creamy oh it  has a kick of chili heat to it and I can  really taste the black pepper in there  oh and those are little poppy eggplant  which just kind of explode with like  little seeds in your mouth as you eat  them and as you bite them okay this one  is their gang soul and with stop Abba  which is pineapple and fish let me taste  a piece of pineapple with some of the  broth  oh yeah that is a wonderful blended  saller  it&amp;#39;s spicy has that sweetness from  pineapple I can definitely live in Samui  with this type of food  this one is gang move a pork curry and I  don&amp;#39;t know what this is it looks like  you know what that is you I have no idea  what kind of vegetable that is it looks  like a cross between okra and zucchini  but I don&amp;#39;t know it could be like a  jungle vegetable  oh I think I think that thing is a  potato maybe uh yeah it&amp;#39;s starchy and  creamy like a potato move it&amp;#39;s cassava  and then you got this nice pile of  vegetables and herbs which you can grab  you&amp;#39;re going to can dip it into that  numpy  those losers are very sour and chalky  and then that numb pick is a little bit  sweet I can taste the shrimp paste in it  and a little bit spicy my favorite thing  in the world  these are stink beans which are  sometimes in curry but also they are  commonly eaten raw as well and it has  this little white film around it which  you could eat but maybe I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll pull  it off so you can see the stink bean  inside one of the most beautiful things  and dip it in the numb pick as well  that&amp;#39;s just a little bite of glory and  then deep-fried fish looks like they are  they&amp;#39;re fully crisp if I&amp;#39;d  just put some of that over onto mine  that would be very good with some of the  numpy  there are a lot of bones in that bite  but that&amp;#39;s awesome  really crispy fish and then with that  Nam picked chili sauce excellent  we just finished with lunch that was  insanely good food if you are looking  for proper southern Thai food in this  Beach area is called mae nam

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.53" dur="5.349">geography and food are inextricably  connected the four farm-to-table came to  popular prominence charging 20 bucks for  local quiche shoots served alongside two  charred spring onion people actually had  to just eat the ingredients that grew  around them  [Music]  from a geographical standpoint one might  be surprised to learn about Nikkei  cuisine a Peruvian and Japanese  crossover that brings together two  countries over 9000 miles apart but from  a migratory perspective this culinary  invention is entirely sensible Japanese  farmers began immigrating to Peru at the  end of the 19th century to work as  contract laborers on coastal plantations  craving a taste of home they were forced  to make do with what they had applying  Japanese culinary techniques to Peruvian  ingredients some of which Peruvian  natives didn&amp;#39;t yet utilize such as eel  and octopus at cents Akana chef Mina  Neumann drawing from her Peruvian roots  collaborated with a Sokka native kikuna  guy to bring the riches of Nikkei  cuisine to a larger audience  nikka cuisine is the marriage of  Japanese Peruvian cultures it said that  they come in two waves one was the late  1800s and then again in like 1920s they  were businessmen that said let&amp;#39;s bring  labor force from Japan as those labor  contracts expired some of them stayed  and they made businesses here they  established their homes here some of  them went back the ones that stayed grew  the culture more and more these people  live in Peru make their food the way  they wanted to make it and they use the  ingredients that Peru has to offer  just some of the research I&amp;#39;ve done it  seems like the relationship between  those two cultures was very fraught yeah  yeah yeah yes absolutely and it&amp;#39;s  interesting because you know you have  examples of like I believe per was the  first Latin American country to allow  Japanese immigration there is a Japanese  proven president president from 1990 to  2000 but then you also had an earthquake  in which there was looting involved and  there was a three-day race riot in 1940  or sorry  right so I&amp;#39;m interested in  these people learn from each other you  put a small diaspora into such a  homogeneous culture or I feel like how  does that mean to talk to the  japanese-style more so later than the  Japanese is necessity of adapting to  where they were brought to just even  eating all the fish the coastal Peru has  to offer was something new to Peruvians  you know they wouldn&amp;#39;t heal in the past  they would you need octopus in the past  the Japanese came and treat the fish  very differently there is no Peruvian  ceviche now without it having Japanese  influence not even in Peru this is a  ceviche classic oh it&amp;#39;s very much what  people think of it&amp;#39;s a white Corvina  fish  it&amp;#39;s mixed with fresh lime juice aji  Lima which is a chili pepper from Peru  cilantro is added at the end and then we  put a lecher the theater which is a  whole separate sauce more or less the  secret ingredient we wore that over the  fish and that&amp;#39;s where we add dashi the  introduction of the dashi that brings  the umami to the dish which is to  Peruvians that doesn&amp;#39;t exist just the  fact that if it tastes delicious while  tastes delicious doesn&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s only  the for sense of something fish mm-hmm  this is one of those beautiful speeches  I&amp;#39;ve ever seen thank you I&amp;#39;ve never seen  this gigantic yes it&amp;#39;s similar to hominy  one thing that really struck me in the  kitchen was that there were surprisingly  inherit similarities between some  Peruvian ingredients and Japanese  ingredients yes for instance I had no  idea that Peru had a seaweed that was  native to it and yes that bonito is  already there but it was never prepared  in this way correct the usage of all  those ingredients is just based on what  people know they didn&amp;#39;t just bring this  bonito and put it in the soup because it  kind of look good they use it as their  the segue to the next part of their  lives  mhm now they knew they were going to  stay and they had to adapt to what they  had  they would take their seaweed and it  would be the Peruvian signal because  that&amp;#39;s what they could get this is art  una tira dito with a toda so just agua I  call it our chili and it has a chili oil  around the dish it&amp;#39;s layered with a  quick pickle of radish avocado cucumbers  and then on top is our u yo thank you  thank you oh my how vibrant all of the  colors are on this table yeah it&amp;#39;s  definitely very Latin America just Peru  was full of that vibrancy yeah do you  mind tell me just a little bit about  your family and your background that  those are doing so my mother is from  Chiclayo Peru which is the north of Lima  and my father was Russian Jewish my  mother was very forward with us we were  raised very Latino speak Spanish at home  eat ate all these dishes at home so much  so that my father wanted to retire in  Peru and you never thought of a Peruvian  Jewish no never  these are cultures not Susan can you  tell me a little bit more about auntie  coaches  I think cool shows are like after you go  partying do you go and have optical  chess  there&amp;#39;s something about old culture  sharing meat on a stick  equals party yes and that&amp;#39;s smell of  charcoal is always reminiscent of seems  like a good time this is our veal calves  are anticucho I love the heart it  reminds me of home I feel like it&amp;#39;s so  Peruvian yeah yeah oh if I go to a  restaurant restaurant I always order  that this is super traditional Peruvian  except our marinade has aji panca it has  miso a Japanese soy sauce and little see  how see how is more of a chinese-style  soy sauce when we were growing up there  was always see out always ginger of  course I was garlic and Chili Peppers  and so when I started to do this  restaurant I read did the R&amp;amp;D and I was  like now this all makes sense wide  because there are dishes that don&amp;#39;t have  any ginger in it and there are dishes  that don&amp;#39;t have CL in it the more I did  more Reese  and asked my mother and my and my  godmother and they work well that this  is all Japanese and Chinese influence  improve the the Chinese they call them  chinos even though they&amp;#39;re Japanese  that&amp;#39;s what they brought to us and I  would say oh that all makes a lot of  sense because the flavors are like that  it said that when they came over they  brought show you in their in their  packages when they and me so that was  another big one that they knew was not  going to be available to them in Peru  the sauce really makes it it&amp;#39;s so nice  to have that combination that ginger  those Chili Peppers they all work so  well together the use of ginger is  another one that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be  people think about in Peru  there were also a big immigration of  Chinese people that came that kind of  that came before the Japanese people so  they brought that ginger planted it and  that already grew until that was innate  to what was already established in Peru  and so Japanese welcome back this is our  pork belly wrapped in a Peruvian cheese  is there a lot of cheese in Peru we love  cheese as a Korean rose in the marriage  of pork belly and melted cheese is like  right up oh I can imagine it with the  rice car yeah it is a glorious thing yes  so taco and I met here and we wanted to  work together but it just never pans out  and so then he moved back to Japan and I  called him up and I said we&amp;#39;re gonna do  a Japanese restaurant so I brought  talked back to Japan and we went to Peru  we ate out like four meals a day went to  the market the fish market all the  produce everywhere where I grew up and  then that we came back and we started  playing with items my Peruvian and his  just the Japanese ingredients so all the  different soy sauces that were great  learning experience for me as well  methods and for him you know working  with chili peppers in general just are a  little hesitant to Japanese people not  used to the cilantro flavor that&amp;#39;s not  in their flavor palate  this dish is our sudah de mariscos and  we use in this one halibut that we&amp;#39;ve  separately pan-seared and then we crisp  up a deep Anka and the shellfish and  ginger and then we deglaze it with users  whereas some people would have eat this  with rice Japanese noodles as a soup in  this restaurant we use for different soy  sauces three different missiles two  different user juices so it&amp;#39;s all over  the place and all of that wouldn&amp;#39;t have  been possible if taco and I didn&amp;#39;t come  together to say this show you is better  than this one or after you see out for  this dish no matter what okay so it&amp;#39;s a  real marriage  absolutely yes absolutely the same of  what the culture is it&amp;#39;s exactly what  Nikkei is you know it is the same  [Music]  collaboration these two marriages these  two great great cultures and cuisines  just coming together and forming once  the next generations the children of  those of the people the children of the  children the children now we&amp;#39;re cooking  can I ask what do you think of the word  fusion oh I hate that word the  definition of it doesn&amp;#39;t seem inherently  bad but it&amp;#39;s become such a such a lazy  connotation it becomes confusion and  when it&amp;#39;s just let me take this rambutan  and put it with Lomo saltado let me fry  it up because it has this kind of  texture that is a confusion mm-hmm where  people were brought here make do made it  their own  and I always assimilate this to the New  York bagel the New York bagel is what  the Eastern Europeans made here in New  York because that&amp;#39;s the bread that was  similar to what they had back home so  you would never call a bagel fusion  because it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s more of an  adaptation mm-hmm right because we all  adapt and make it our own and so that&amp;#39;s  what the Nikkei people didn&amp;#39;t prove  there are obtained as they grown through  years and years and years of what was  around in Peru and they and they use  things that Peruvians what New Zealand  the fish the seaweed alone it was right  there and people just thought it was  below them to use it mm-hmm okay let&amp;#39;s  talk about this last issue this is one  of my favorite and this potato this is a  yellow potato it&amp;#39;s cooked first and then  it&amp;#39;s super frozen and then it&amp;#39;s fried  again so that is crispy on the outside  and creamy on the inside a big starch  country did the rice and potatoes yes  this potato has changed Japanese people  because they came from the time of war  were so amazed that they could have so  much rice it was a luxury to have what  was your interest in approaching this  cuisine instead of traditional Peruvian  dishes it this is it&amp;#39;s time it&amp;#39;s time to  have another level of Peruvian food we  have the boil of Arase we have the  Creole restaurants and so I thought that  was this time as ever you know now we  just have to do things very different  and so it&amp;#39;s nice that Peruvian food is  finally having their moment in it&amp;#39;s  great to be able to introduce another  element of it it&amp;#39;s time for a Nikkei to  have its audience and stage  [Music]</text><text start="3.03" dur="5.279"></text><text start="5.879" dur="4.441"></text><text start="8.309" dur="4.29"></text><text start="10.32" dur="4.02"></text><text start="12.599"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.359" dur="4.351">we have a dog that&amp;#39;s unresponsive it&amp;#39;s  not breathing it&amp;#39;s not reacting to you  what do you do if you know CPR you know  exactly what to do and that&amp;#39;s this is  what this webinar is all about let&amp;#39;s  suppose your golf just fell in this  swimming pool or the river and then you  managed to get them out and they&amp;#39;re  lying on the side and they&amp;#39;re  unconscious you wonder is the heart  beating are they breathing this is what  you need to know how to do CPR and  there&amp;#39;s also other things that can  trigger this electrocution being hit by  a car a lot of things like that so this  webinar is going to show you how to do  CPR in both dogs and cats I&amp;#39;m dr. Jeff  dragnet and this is my friend Courtney  and Courtney is good and I are going to  show you how to do CPR in dogs all this  will also apply to caps there&amp;#39;s going to  be one little thing later I&amp;#39;ll tell you  the difference with but everything I&amp;#39;m  going to show you is going to apply to  cats CPR as well the first thing we&amp;#39;re  going to be checking is the a of the  ABCs and that is the airway we want to  know do we have air going in from the  nose into the chest and then in other  words do we have an open airway so the  first thing we&amp;#39;re going to do is check  the mouth I&amp;#39;m going to turn Courtney  around and the way we do that is to pull  the tongue out and then have a look  inside and then do a sweep check pulling  out whatever might be in there now the  key with that is if you have a dog that  then tries to bite us as we&amp;#39;re doing it  we probably don&amp;#39;t need to do CPR so  anyway check and do a swab as long as  the dog will allow it if if she does  then the next thing we&amp;#39;re going to do is  do a test breath and the way we do that  is by blowing in the nostrils and then  we&amp;#39;re going to watch the chest go up and  down  so if you just saw that we can see that  this chest was moving up and down so we  have an open airway another way quick  way to check is to also do put pressure  on the chest at the same time feeling in  front of the nostrils so that way we can  see or as we feel if there&amp;#39;s air coming  out we can also put our face here and we  can feel it and so that tells us we have  an open airway that&amp;#39;s the first step the  next thing is do we have breathing now  sometimes this isn&amp;#39;t that easy to spot  but I want you to have a look for this  watch the chest and see if it&amp;#39;s moving  up and down the other thing you can do  is to put your hand on it and just feel  it see if it feels like it&amp;#39;s moving okay  and the other thing that we just did  with the push on the chest sometimes  that will stimulate a breath great if  they&amp;#39;re breathing we don&amp;#39;t need to  breathe for them in most cases so if we  bought all that working next thing is  see circulation now in human land one of  the things that they do usually is they  will check for a pulse like in the wrist  or in the carotid or right on the chest  itself you see an ECG or some type of a  machine and that way it tells us that  the heart&amp;#39;s working or not with dogs  it&amp;#39;s a lot harder to check the pulse so  sometimes you&amp;#39;re feeling it down here  what called femoral pulse that&amp;#39;s right  on the back leg other times you&amp;#39;re  feeling the chest to see if you can feel  the beat but what the latest guidelines  are is that you shouldn&amp;#39;t bother doing  that if the dog it looks like it needs  to have what we call thoracic  compressions done and that is pushing  down to get the heart pumping we don&amp;#39;t  want to waste time try to check a pulse  we go straight to working on the heart  doing the compressions okay so anyway  let&amp;#39;s move on to that because that&amp;#39;s  going to be our next thing we check the  airway it&amp;#39;s open the breathing is not  happening  we&amp;#39;ve got enough reason then to move  right in doing compressions  there&amp;#39;s two ways to do compression  dogs one is putting pressure right over  the heart and the other one is putting  pressure the what we call the greatest  width of the chest which is just up from  there there&amp;#39;s the heart and here&amp;#39;s the  other place now the difference between  the two is based on the anatomy of the  dog but the majority of dogs you&amp;#39;re  going to do it at the point of the  highest width or the largest width of  the chest and the way you&amp;#39;re going to do  it is just like you do it in people and  that is you have two hands on the chest  and be pushing down now when you&amp;#39;re  pushing down the first thing you have to  determine is what rate do you use the  rate is about 120 per minute and this is  just like it is in people and that is  the song the Bee Gees hit weather which  was stayin alive you&amp;#39;re going to start  just doing that to that beat now the  both the any dogs and any cats both of  them are done in the same rate we used  to do smaller animals at a faster rate  but now we know that that was too fast  it didn&amp;#39;t allow time for the chest to  refill to rebound so we wanted to use  the rate of 120 and so we&amp;#39;re going to  put our hands together right over the  point of the highest sort of otherwise  the thickest diameter of the chest and  we&amp;#39;re going to put hush down about half  to a third of the width of the chest so  it&amp;#39;s considerable amount and that&amp;#39;s how  we&amp;#39;re going to do it we&amp;#39;re going to keep  our arms locked we&amp;#39;re going to keep our  arms straight we&amp;#39;re not going to be  doing it like this we&amp;#39;re going to keep  it locked and use our core strength our  back to get things moving and that way  you&amp;#39;ll be able to keep things going now  the way that we do it in in dogs and  cats is we want to put the pressure on  and do about 30 compressions at a rate  of 120 a minute so you&amp;#39;re going to be  doing one two three four five six keep  going 28 29 30 and then you take a break  you go to the nose and you give two  quick breaths both of them within our  lasting about a second check into this  like so and then you go back to just  okay so that&amp;#39;s the rhythm that you&amp;#39;re  going to do if you&amp;#39;ve got one person  you&amp;#39;re going to be doing the chest  you&amp;#39;re going to be moving to the nose  you&amp;#39;re going to be doing the chest and  back to the nose if you&amp;#39;ve got two  people then one person can do 30  compressions the other person can do two  breaths and the same person goes back to  doing the compressions again the key is  try to trade off you shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing  the compressions for about two minutes  at a time or else you will get fatigued  and what happens is that when you&amp;#39;re  doing this you&amp;#39;re getting a little bit  tired you&amp;#39;re going to push down you&amp;#39;re  not going to get off the chest  completely and it&amp;#39;s because of that is  going to be a little bit residual  pressure and that&amp;#39;s going to make the  chest not fill or rebound as well as it  should so you want to stay fresh doing  this so I would do two minutes with  someone else blowing then we&amp;#39;d rotate  while I give the breaths and they do the  compressions okay now I&amp;#39;m going to show  you how to do this properly in one  moment but we talked about cats and also  little tiny dogs when they&amp;#39;re just very  small and that is I&amp;#39;m talking the ones  that are under ten pounds or so what you  can do rather than doing the  compressions like that and you can do it  that way but what you find is you can  just usually put your hand right around  the chest and then use your hands to do  the chest compressions it&amp;#39;s a little bit  easier and you put your hand behind the  back and the other one around the chest  and just do the compressions that way  and then do the same thing 30 and then  do the things on the nose so that&amp;#39;s the  way you can do it what you want to do is  to get your dog and get it in position  so you know how to do it don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t  start pounding on the chest  I don&amp;#39;t want you doing that but what I  want you to do is sir just go through  the mechanics of it and that is you get  your dog lying in front of you then you  can sort of say okay I&amp;#39;d be doing this  and then I would give a breath then I  would do it again and that way you can  just see how it gets done and hopefully  hopefully you&amp;#39;ll never have to use it  that&amp;#39;s what we hope in human side and  that is with a lot of us learn CPR and  we hope we never have to use it but when  it comes critical we know we know how to  do it so let&amp;#39;s move down I&amp;#39;m going to  move our little part knee down to the  floor so you can just see how we do it  in a larger dog so I&amp;#39;ve got Courtney on  the floor and this is how we&amp;#39;re going to  normally doing CPR in a dog you&amp;#39;re going  to be pushed up against our knees and  that way not moving backwards on us and  we&amp;#39;re going to be able to go right over  top and that way we can put the pressure  on and using our bags do it like that  okay so the key is being stable and you  being balanced you&amp;#39;re not falling over  at all you want to be nice and square  right over top you cross your hands over  and go right up its highest point of the  chest and put the pressure on if you&amp;#39;ve  got a dog that&amp;#39;s the sighthound  as in you have a very narrow chest we  are going to do what we call cardiac  compressions and little directly over  the heart but that that&amp;#39;s another  technique entirely so I&amp;#39;ll show you the  most common one and that is we&amp;#39;re going  to start doing compressions right here  on the highest point and so we&amp;#39;re going  to start going one two three four five  six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve  thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen  seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty  twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three  twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six  twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine  thirty and then immediately and go the  nose then do two breaths and then go  right back to it so that&amp;#39;s the technique  and are you going to damage ribs as  possible but the chances are quite low  except if you&amp;#39;ve got  very old dog very we call them crispy  rips and very calcified in most dogs and  cats especially cats you&amp;#39;re not going to  break a rib unless you&amp;#39;re really very  forceful so anyway that&amp;#39;s how we do it  and hopefully I&amp;#39;m answering some  questions on how to do CPR in dogs and  cat so that&amp;#39;s it for CPR lesson for  today Courtney&amp;#39;s been a great patient  she&amp;#39;s always she&amp;#39;s always very compliant  anyway we are going to be developing a  course in CPR that you can take yourself  and that way you can learn the real  mechanics and become certified in that  that&amp;#39;s this will be a little bit later  for now take what I&amp;#39;ve taught you  practice sort of with your dogs and your  cats just so you know how to do this and  I said hopefully you&amp;#39;ll never need it  but you&amp;#39;re ready if you do so anyway  thank you for watching this webinar well  I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll get you another one  and have fun with your dogs</text><text start="2.49" dur="5.4"></text><text start="4.71" dur="5.73"></text><text start="7.89" dur="13.92"></text><text start="10.44" dur="12.81"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.88" dur="3.56">[Music]  everybody poops  it&amp;#39;s one of those facts of life the  average person does it anywhere between  three times a week and three times a day  so by the time you&amp;#39;re an adult you&amp;#39;re a  very experienced pooper but sometimes  even with the right diet and exercise  you still need a little help with your  number two and that&amp;#39;s where laxatives  come in constipation is pretty common  with anywhere between two and thirty  percent of people experiencing symptoms  at any given time it can be caused by  lack of exercise many medications or  certain diets changing your habits might  solve the problem but if not there are a  whole bunch of laxatives to make your  pooping experience more enjoyable the  most common type are called bulk formers  and they&amp;#39;re basically concentrated doses  of dietary fiber dietary fiber is a  broad term for the parts of plants we  eat but that our bodies can&amp;#39;t digest and  you&amp;#39;ll find it in things like whole  wheat breads and vegetables there are  two kinds of it soluble fiber which can  dissolve in water and form gels an  insoluble fiber which doesn&amp;#39;t bulk  forming laxatives adds soluble fiber to  your intestines which makes your stool  full of soft squishy fiber gel that  makes them larger and heavier while  keeping them soft and easy to pass these  are some of the safest laxatives to take  long term which makes them popular but  if fiber gels aren&amp;#39;t your style you have  some other options another kind osmotic  laxatives work by making the  concentration of certain salts or sugars  higher in your intestines than outside  them to equalize the concentrations and  get things back to normal water from the  rest of your body is pulled into your  intestines and that creates a waterslide  for anything inside your colon if you&amp;#39;ve  ever had to hit the bathroom after  eating sugarfree gummy bears this is why  they&amp;#39;re sweetened using sugar alcohols  like multi tall which is a potent  osmotic laxative there are also  stimulant laxatives which increase the  number of contractions in your  intestinal walls by stimulating the  nerves controlling them the contractions  cause stool to travel faster through  your digestive tracts so this kind of  laxative tends to act the fastest  now most laxatives are known for helping  out with constipation but they can be  helpful for other things too like if  you&amp;#39;ve just had surgery and shouldn&amp;#39;t be  straining your muscles in the bathroom  to make regular bowel movements easier  to pass there are lubricant laxatives  like mineral oil that coat your  intestinal walls to make them slippery  and emollient laxatives also called  stool softeners those decrease the  surface tension of fatty stools allowing  them to absorb water and become soft  like how soaps and detergents let water  and oils mix when you&amp;#39;re washing your  hands so no matter your poop situation  there is a laxative for you at the end  of the day a healthy diet and exercise  go a long way in keeping your body  running smoothly but the next time  you&amp;#39;re feeling bloated and wishing for a  visit from the poop fairy you have  options for helping nature along just  maybe don&amp;#39;t choose that bag of gummy  bears thanks for asking and thanks to  all of our patrons on patreon who keep  these answers coming  if you&amp;#39;d like to submit a question you  can go to patreon.com/scishow  [Music]</text><text start="2.84"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.04" dur="9.29">[Music]  hey guys welcome to our new home this is  going to be the first video in our home  renovation series but I wanted to show  you the room that we&amp;#39;re going to start  with this is our great room or the  second level it&amp;#39;s just kind of a big  converted attic space and the reason  we&amp;#39;re going to start here is because  this is actually going to be where our  three boys are going to sleep we&amp;#39;ve got  three really nice windows looking out  into the backyard here we&amp;#39;ve got a  bathroom over here that&amp;#39;s going to be  converted soon we&amp;#39;ve also got this  little alcove thing down here we&amp;#39;re not  exactly sure what we&amp;#39;re going to do with  this but for this video the main thing  is we&amp;#39;re going to worry about our  cleaning up the trim painting some of  the windows taking down the overhead  fluorescent lights and putting in some  fans and mainly putting in hardwood  floors alright let&amp;#39;s get to it  overall the ceilings not too bad but we  do have a few water spots here that  we&amp;#39;re from an old roof leak which has  been fixed since then we&amp;#39;re going to try  just to paint over that one section but  usually when you paint a ceiling with  ceiling paint it&amp;#39;s a lot brighter which  is really good but it doesn&amp;#39;t blend well  with what&amp;#39;s already there so we&amp;#39;re going  to try painting this one little section  and see how it goes and see if we can  avoid pinning the entire ceiling but  that&amp;#39;s probably not the case there is  also a texture on this ceiling which I  would love to take off but it&amp;#39;s not  really that bad and it&amp;#39;s a huge area to  try to remove so I think we&amp;#39;re just  going to leave it there for now ceiling  painting is really just flat white paint  but it makes the entire room look  brighter just to have white on the  ceiling I&amp;#39;m also not worried about  getting paint on this floor who&amp;#39;s going  to get covered up with hardwoods pretty  soon that paint covered up the stain  perfectly well but like I was expecting  it&amp;#39;s a lot brighter than the color  that&amp;#39;s already on the ceiling just  because it&amp;#39;s kind of old and not super  bright white so we&amp;#39;re going to have to  roll the entire ceiling which is not a  huge deal but before we do that we also  have to take down these lights so that  we can paint the area underneath them  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  it&amp;#39;s now day two so a new one we did a  lot of work kind of prepping stuff we  got pretty good and this morning we  already started switching out some other  receptacles from some brand new white  ones while we were changing up those  receptacles we realized that some of  them are really high up on the walls for  no apparent reason so we&amp;#39;re going to  drop some lines down further in the wall  and put some about 16 inches off the  ground we&amp;#39;re going to wait till after  the floor then and do all of that turn  paint at one time add the ceiling fans  and to do that we&amp;#39;ve got to add boxes up  within the rafters there actually aren&amp;#39;t  up there already which is a little bit  strange so we&amp;#39;re going to have to crawl  up into that attic space against the  studs to support the weight of the fans  so just a few more here and there and  then floors and call this room finished  adding or replacing receptacles is a  really easy thing to do and if you&amp;#39;re  going from an off-white to a white it  makes the room looks much newer once I  got the bottom one added into this new  wire I just swapped out the old  receptacle up top and attach the other  end of that new wire to this receptacle  as well this is the upstairs bathroom  and we&amp;#39;ve actually got a crew coming in  to replace this bathroom entirely for us  we&amp;#39;ve got three other bathrooms in the  house to do so we&amp;#39;re going to let  somebody else do this one so it can be  done the right way and very quickly that  way our boys can actually get into this  room and start using it but this door  needs to swing out so we&amp;#39;re going to  pull out this trim on the outside pull  out the door frame flip it around and  put it back in  [Music]  [Applause]  when we went to mop the ceiling fans  there weren&amp;#39;t any electrical boxes in  the ceiling and these spots were right  in between joists so we found these cool  hanger bars that you can feed up through  a hole  Lock them into place and then attach a  box to them they work great and ceiling  fans are super easy to install they -  it&amp;#39;s going really well although it&amp;#39;s  kind of late in the day we&amp;#39;ve got the  fans up they took longer than I thought  but they are nice and secure with those  hangers that I showed you and they make  the place way cooler and it&amp;#39;s finally  time for the floors and we&amp;#39;re going to  use solid oak for the flooring up here  we priced out a bunch of different  options for bamboo or engineered or  veneer or all these different things but  we really wanted solid hardwood in  looking at all the different hardwood  options we came across this one product  that&amp;#39;s actually a click together  hardwood it&amp;#39;s kind of like engineered  where you can lay it down and it floats  you lock these pieces together they stay  in place so we&amp;#39;re going to end up with a  3/4 inch saw one word wood floor that&amp;#39;s  floating you don&amp;#39;t have to nail it down  it&amp;#39;s supposed to go a lot faster than  traditional hardwood  we&amp;#39;ll find out so the first step is to  put down the underlayment which is going  to help dampen some of the sound both  and step on it and from the floor  beneath this room before we put the  under limit down though I wanted to  point out one thing  there&amp;#39;s linoleum on this floor already  but instead of taking it up we&amp;#39;re just  going to float the floor right on top of  it that alone will make it go a lot  faster the big thing is you have to  leave at least a 3/8 inch gap all the  way around the room this is so that the  wood can expand and contract without  causing a problem we&amp;#39;re going to use  some spacers up against these walls in  this corner to actually get started  laying these out once we get this down  they should snap right together and we  should be able to move all the way to  the end of the room before going on the  second row we chose an underlayment  that&amp;#39;s made to dampen sound because well  little boys we started with the first  piece in the corner using the spacers  and then went down that first wall this  stuff is so easy to put down that my  six-year-old was able to do quite a bit  of appliances  after you get that first row down  everything just locks together when it  comes to working around door frames or  any other trim a jigsaw is a really  great way to get these cut to fit these  multi tools are great for notching out  little pieces as well also a chisel is  handy to have around these are just  trial and error you keep working at it  until they fit when you&amp;#39;re laying floor  the last row is probably not going to be  a full width board I used a table saw to  rip these down to their final width  before dropping them in place the  quarter round is going to hold them down  when you come to door frames you also  might want to notch out the frame using  one of these multi tools as well so  pieces can slide right underneath once  we have the floor is finished we added  some quarter around all the way around  the room and then painted it white  that&amp;#39;s it for the update on this room  we&amp;#39;re really happy with how it turned  out and it&amp;#39;s amazing how much of a  change can happen into space just by  adding some new floors and paint on the  walls to new fixtures let&amp;#39;s not quickly  about the stuff that I used in this room  and let me give you my thoughts on it  specifically the flooring when we were  looking at flooring for the entire house  we looked at all the options each one  has different properties and there are  different reasons to go with different  things but we decided that we wanted  hardwood this room up here is separated  from the rest of the house so we wanted  to use it as a test bed to try out this  flooring before we bought a whole bunch  to put everywhere else it turns out that  it&amp;#39;s a really nice product it goes down  very quickly and very easily but I&amp;#39;m not  sure that the cost of it scales up we  have a lot of other area in our house  where we want to put down hard work so  we decided that instead of using the  click together stuff for the rest of the  house we are going to get nailed down  hardwood and spend the extra money on  getting a nicer wood than oak but for up  here as a bonus room and the kids room  this stuff works great and it was really  quick and easy to do I&amp;#39;m going to have a  link down in the description that will  list this hardwood in case you want to  check it out along with all the other  stuff I use the fans especially the  mounting brackets that I use to mount  the fan in the ceiling that&amp;#39;s a great  way to add a fan to any existing ceiling  the room is finished we&amp;#39;re very happy  with how it turned out and this level of  DIY is something that I think anybody  can take on just a few days and you can  have a completely updated room in your  that about wraps up this room the last  thing we got to do is just decorate it  move in some furniture and get it ready  for our boys I&amp;#39;d love to know what you  think about this video and my new home  series if you have any comments or  suggestions leave them down in the  comments that&amp;#39;d be awesome  if you&amp;#39;re not into home renovation I&amp;#39;ve  got lots of other types of projects that  you might be interested in and if you  never want to miss an upcoming project  or home renovation project be sure to  subscribe that&amp;#39;s it for this one

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.08" dur="3.599">this is maggie the labrador retriever  puppy and for the next 20 minutes  instructor steve&amp;#39;s gonna work with her  on something called  leash respect it&amp;#39;s where he gives her  the opportunity to choose him  over choosing to pull on her leash she&amp;#39;s  actually also going to work a little bit  on jumping up and i know that&amp;#39;s  something that a lot of dog owners  struggle with  on that note i&amp;#39;m ken steepe i&amp;#39;m steve  welsh and this is maggie  welcome back to mccann dogs  [Music]  like any other exercise we teach our  dogs it&amp;#39;s important we break it down  into little steps to help our dogs be  correct  now when i talk about the idea of least  respect it doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me  where she is it just matters to me that  she&amp;#39;s not pulling on the leash now  i&amp;#39;ve picked a great motivator for maggie  i&amp;#39;ve got some cheese here and she seems  to like this cheese really really well  in fact i&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is the  first time she&amp;#39;s had cheese but with  your dog you&amp;#39;re going to need to make  sure that you pick a motivator  that is important to them and powerful  to them  now here&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m going to do i&amp;#39;m  going to simply tell her with me  and i&amp;#39;m going to take a step and i&amp;#39;m  going to pause and as long as she pauses  with me i&amp;#39;m quickly going to say yes and  i&amp;#39;m going to reward  now it&amp;#39;s important to remember she  doesn&amp;#39;t have to be at my left side  she can be anywhere around me and as  long as she doesn&amp;#39;t pull on the leash  i&amp;#39;m going to quickly deliver that treat  here&amp;#39;s the other side of the coin though  if she decides to pull on the leash i&amp;#39;m  going to turn and face her and i&amp;#39;m going  to add some of those pulses on the leash  that i&amp;#39;ll show you in a second  to simply encourage her to reconnect  with me when she does  i&amp;#39;m going to turn on my voice in motion  and move away from her and encourage her  to stay with me a little bit more oh hi  girl she&amp;#39;s very excited  and again i haven&amp;#39;t worked with maggie  so we&amp;#39;re going to see what happens here  i like how she how excited she is though  so  let&amp;#39;s go ahead and do this so i&amp;#39;m going  to have some food in my hand ready to go  but i&amp;#39;m not going to lure her this food  is up out of the way it is a reward now  you can tell she knows i have it and  that&amp;#39;s a really really really good thing  so here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to look like with  me yes good girl  very good with me yes good girly  with me she&amp;#39;s going to turn and move  so she&amp;#39;s probably she&amp;#39;s pulling a little  she&amp;#39;s making a good choice there&amp;#39;s my  girl good job with me  yes good girl with me yes  good girly very nice now i&amp;#39;m gonna take  another step with me  and see what she does so she&amp;#39;s gonna  jump i&amp;#39;m gonna tell her off  good off good girl with me yes good girl  you notice when i bring the food down  i&amp;#39;m bringing it down quickly to help  prevent her from  jumping even though she&amp;#39;s excited i&amp;#39;m  bringing the food down quickly she only  gets rewarded for four paws on the  ground  and i&amp;#39;m going to keep doing this a  couple more times with me  yes good girl so she pulled on the leash  oh i got you i did ah that&amp;#39;s funny good  girl  with me yes good girl very good so the  moment that leash went tight  i put a little slack in the leash added  a few pulses until she turned back to me  but then i praised her and i became more  fun than everything else around her now  we&amp;#39;re in our hall and it&amp;#39;s an empty hall  right now because i want to set maggie  up to be successful i want to make sure  i  limit the distractions to build her  foundation and understanding  and even though it&amp;#39;s a fairly empty hall  she&amp;#39;s still pretty excited about the  world and that&amp;#39;s a really good thing  most new puppies are excited about  things this cheese that i have is really  important to her  and that&amp;#39;s going to be of value when i  start to do this i&amp;#39;m not going to add  any more distractions right now  i&amp;#39;m simply going to continue to work  this idea of a couple of steps  and a pause and as long as she pauses  with me the good stuff happens and when  she doesn&amp;#39;t no big deal i&amp;#39;m not mad at  her but i&amp;#39;m quickly using my leads to  redirect her  to bring her right back now i am going  to try and make it a little bit harder  but i&amp;#39;m not going to do that by adding a  lot of distractions i&amp;#39;m going to do that  by adding  one more step so instead of one step at  a time it&amp;#39;s going to be two steps at a  time okay and here&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s going to  look like  with me one two yes good girl very good  with me  yes good girly good job and get a little  bit more food good girl  excellent job whoops off so i&amp;#39;m going to  work a little bit of that off  and this is what most exciting puppies  are going to do that&amp;#39;s okay we&amp;#39;re just  going to help work with them  with me yes good girly good with me  yes good girl with me  yes good puppy dog now she is making  absolutely fantastic choices  off and again i&amp;#39;m just going to deal  with the jumping as it goes i&amp;#39;m not mad  at her she&amp;#39;s excited and engaged with me  so i&amp;#39;m going to make sure that i help  keep her with me with me off girl  go ahead with me yes good girl you&amp;#39;ll  notice the more i do this the more  excited maggie actually gets to and we  are getting a fair bit of jumping right  now this is pretty common with these  excited young puppies first things first  she is being excited she&amp;#39;s not being  overbearing but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean i&amp;#39;m  not going to address it i&amp;#39;m going to  tell her  off and i&amp;#39;m just going to add some  pulses to the ground each and every time  she jumps i&amp;#39;m not mad at her  she is simply an excited puppy at this  point but it is important i address it  each and every time  off good girly good off  excellent job and i can even take the  opportunity to yes  and reward her for keeping four paws on  the ground  good off very nice i&amp;#39;m gonna combine  these two now  a little bit of leash respect and  addressing that off  okay with me yes good girl good job  good with me with me off  good off good with me yes  good girl what a superstar labrador  retriever you are with me  yes good girl and you can see how  quickly  she starts to figure out that she  shouldn&amp;#39;t jump and the good things come  for keeping four paws on the ground  we&amp;#39;ve started to get some success now  without any any distractions down  anytime i want to add things in though i  need to add them slowly  to help her understand how to be correct  so  i&amp;#39;ve put some toys down on the ground  and these are pretty exciting for her  she heard one of them squeaking  she was pretty interested in them you&amp;#39;ll  notice off that i&amp;#39;ve moved back from  those toys a little bit i&amp;#39;m going to do  the exact same exercise  back here far away from those toys to  help her understand  that she shouldn&amp;#39;t pull on the leash in  spite of those distractions being there  now same rules are going to apply  i&amp;#39;m going to have some food in my hand  ready to go i am not luring her i am  rewarding her for making choices so  you&amp;#39;ll notice when i move i&amp;#39;m not moving  with food on her nose the food is  up out of the way but it&amp;#39;s there that i  can quickly say yes and reward her  and i&amp;#39;m going to take one or two steps  toward those towards those toys and as  long as she doesn&amp;#39;t pull on the leash  i&amp;#39;m going to yes and reward are you  ready girl  with me off so again i can address the  jumping off  to get your pog from under there off  good off  with me yes good girl good job very nice  good get it  good with me yes good girl i might move  a little further away with me  off off good off  with me off and this is pretty common  that the dogs get a little bit excited  and start to do things repetitively  people often ask us how many times  you&amp;#39;re gonna have to do this before my  dog understands  and really it comes down to yes good  girl as many times  as it takes for them to understand what  we want i&amp;#39;m never mad at them i&amp;#39;m simply  giving them the best direction i can to  help them to be correct  with me off yes good girl good with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girly with me  yes good girl now i gotta say with me  girlie she just made off  a fantastic choice these toys were there  she looked at them and paused for a  second but then look back to me  i yes that and i gave her a little  jackpot but i also didn&amp;#39;t hang out there  i made a little bit more space to help  her make the right choice  okay and then i&amp;#39;m going to try it again  so a little tension in the leash  oh i caught you i did yeah good try girl  off  good that&amp;#39;s better yes what a good puppy  dog  and i&amp;#39;m gonna repeat these steps i&amp;#39;ll go  a little closer again with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girl very good  puppy dog and then again once i&amp;#39;ve been  this successful  with me good girl i&amp;#39;m gonna move away  to help her be successful so toys are  not something that seems to be a big  uh draw for her so i&amp;#39;m gonna make it a  little harder  but again i&amp;#39;m gonna still do it in a  controlled fashion i&amp;#39;ve asked ken to  come out here and stand here and he&amp;#39;s  just to be a human distraction  because oftentimes that&amp;#39;s where these  little social butterflies  can really struggle so same steps are  going to apply my  expectation is that she doesn&amp;#39;t pull on  the leash in spite of ken being there  now i am not going to go rushing up to  ken  and have her rehearse jumping all over  ken i&amp;#39;m going to build more value for  her staying with me  and focusing on me and one thing i want  to highlight right here do you notice  how she&amp;#39;s turned and faced me right now  i very much make a habit of rewarding  these dogs  turning towards me understanding that  good stuff comes from me  instead of just magically appearing  while they&amp;#39;re looking everywhere else in  the world  so here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to be like my  leash has got up i&amp;#39;ve got the food in my  hand  i&amp;#39;m not going to lure her with it and  i&amp;#39;m going to take a step towards ken  with me  yes good girlie with me  yes good girl and i might move back a  little bit with me  yes good girl now it&amp;#39;s important to note  um she&amp;#39;s not jumping as much right now  part of that is simply we&amp;#39;ve addressed  it each and every time with me  yes good with me excellent job and i&amp;#39;m  gonna push this hard here  with me yes good girl she&amp;#39;s making great  choices right now off  good off yes good girl and i&amp;#39;m going to  really  actually try and push her because she&amp;#39;s  making such great choices  i&amp;#39;m going to really see if we can test  her in this situation with me  whoops i caught you i did hahaha  good day off let&amp;#39;s get your leash sorted  out and with me  good with me yes good girl so that was a  little bit too much for her brain she  saw ken kneel down and thought  oh i should go and jump on ken so i just  simply added those pulses and moved away  off and i&amp;#39;m reestablishing her idea of  leash respect with me yes good girl with  me  yes good girl with me  yes good girly excellent good job  very nice the next step i&amp;#39;m going to  make with her is i&amp;#39;m actually going to  take food out of my hand i&amp;#39;m not going  to hold it  i have it in my bait pouch i have it  ready to go i have easy access to it  off but i&amp;#39;m going to now simply say yes  reach for that food and reward her and  again this is a step that we take  away from holding food on our hand you  know we are not  bribing her to move with us we&amp;#39;re  rewarding her but this is going to be  our first step so again she can be on my  right that&amp;#39;s fine as long as she&amp;#39;s not  pulling on the leash  with me yes good girly so i&amp;#39;m saying yes  reaching in my bait pouch and rewarding  her with me  yes good girl good job very nice  with me yes  good girl good with me okay get it  good girlie with me  yes good girl maggie&amp;#39;s doing a fantastic  job and i&amp;#39;ve already moved to the point  where i&amp;#39;ve been testing her not holding  food in my hand  but like any time when i introduce new  distractions  i need to back things up to help her to  be correct  so here&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m going to do i&amp;#39;m  actually going to prop this door open in  a minute because  oftentimes people say my dog does it  great inside that empty hall  i should just go outside and they wonder  why the dogs struggle with all of that  new environment so  here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to do i&amp;#39;m going  to take some food i&amp;#39;m going to put in my  hand  in a minute and work a little bit of  this leash respect here with the door  closed  and then i&amp;#39;m going to prop the door open  and we&amp;#39;re going to see how it goes same  rules apply though  she needs to move with me on a loose  leash i&amp;#39;m still only moving a couple of  steps at a time  and i&amp;#39;m still rewarding her for those  great choices so i&amp;#39;ve got some food here  just as a little refresher  she knows i do with me yes good girly  with me  yes good girl with me yes good girl  let&amp;#39;s open the door and see how it goes  the door&amp;#39;s open now i&amp;#39;m my goal is not  to go right out the door my goal  is for her to show me great leash  respect in spite of this door being open  hi girl you got me off guard there good  girly  so here&amp;#39;s what it looks like with me yes  good girly  with me yes good girl i&amp;#39;m going to move  away from the door with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girl with me  yes good girly very good with me  yes good girl now she&amp;#39;s doing quite well  so i&amp;#39;m actually going to push this  i&amp;#39;m going to go out the door a couple of  steps and work my way back in with me  yes good girl it&amp;#39;s important our dogs  learn not to rush through doors ahead of  us it&amp;#39;s important that they learn to be  respectful as we do that and this is  going to help with those  with me so a little pulling a leash  hi i caught you yes i did so here&amp;#39;s what  i&amp;#39;m going to do i&amp;#39;m going to pop back  inside  with me yes good girlie get it good girl  are you ready are you set  with me yes good girl very good girl  with me yes good girl  with me yes good girlie  with me girl  yes good girl now that was a lot for  little maggie to do and she did a great  job with that  you&amp;#39;ll notice though when i came back in  i took a couple of big steps and i  stopped  and she actually fixed herself there was  a little tension that went in the leash  and the moment she felt it she actually  turned back towards me  those are great things to look for that  tells me she is starting to understand  the exercise now this has been a lot of  work for this dog  um she&amp;#39;s getting a little tired and a  little over it so we&amp;#39;re going to take a  break shortly  but even though she&amp;#39;s getting a little  tired i still expect  that she&amp;#39;s not pulling the leash right  now anytime she&amp;#39;s getting up i&amp;#39;m simply  placing her back in that set she still  shouldn&amp;#39;t jump up in me  all of our dog training rules still  apply throughout the entire exercise  good girl you&amp;#39;re a good thing you&amp;#39;ll get  to have a little nap soon good little  labrador retriever yes you are good girl  now we&amp;#39;ve spent the last uh 10 or 15  minutes teaching maggie the idea of  least respect and also working on some  jumping up and these are  very common issues that a lot of dog  owners experience now if you want to  watch a little bit more about least  respect you can click that card right  there where i did a little bit of that  work  with my own puppy final now if this is  your first time on the channel make sure  you hit that subscribe button we publish  new videos every

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.91" dur="6.64">hi my name is Steve in this two-part  video I&amp;#39;m going to be building little  wooden gift boxes and they open up and  they&amp;#39;ve got a nice lip for the lid to  fit now I picked this technique up and a  woodworking book a number of years ago  and it&amp;#39;s a great technique so I want to  spend most of the video really just  showing you how to make this nice lid  and have it fit just perfectly onto a  box using just a router for this one I  used scrap pieces of lace wood and I put  a evany inlay in there and of course you  can make these any size you want and  it&amp;#39;s a great project you can get one  done in a day and I&amp;#39;ll get started and  to start out I took that 3/4 inch piece  of lace wood and re-sod it on the  bandsaw so I have two pieces and then  ramming through later a couple of times  to get them down to about 3/8 of an inch  thick and accounting for the snipe on  the ends which I will have to cut off  I&amp;#39;m going to measure this out and figure  out what size I want to make the Box  nice part about making these is that you  can make them whatever size you want in  this case I&amp;#39;ve got about 12 inches of  usable space I can use here and with  that I need four sides so I think  actually I&amp;#39;m going to just make them  three inches square this box and then  that&amp;#39;ll give me an extra three inches on  each side that I can use district  running tests when I go through the  router since this is a scrap wood  project I found another piece of lace  wood that I had previously planed down  to it looks like a little more than a  eighth of an inch little bit thicker so  I&amp;#39;m going to use that for the top I  thought about using some maple but you  know this is a little scrap I probably  won&amp;#39;t use for anything else so I might  as well use it now and for the bottom of  the box  I&amp;#39;m just going to use a quarter-inch  plywood because this is going to get  covered up both on each side and so it  doesn&amp;#39;t need to be anything fancy so to  get started with the two side pieces  that I have cut before I cut these two  lengths I want to make a rabbet along  the top edge that the top can fit down  into and I want to make a little bit  thicker rabbet on the bottom so that the  plywood panel can fit into that so I&amp;#39;ll  take that over to the router so to cut  those rabbits for the top and bottom  panels I&amp;#39;ve set up a straight bit now  I&amp;#39;m lining it up the height of your bit  can really be kind of anywhere you want  to get it about Center and that&amp;#39;s going  to be fine there because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s  going to support the top the critical  dimension is the depth that you set your  fence because that needs to be the same  depth as the top panel you use in my  case I&amp;#39;m using that panel it&amp;#39;s a little  bit more than an eighth of an inch so  I&amp;#39;ve set this back about an eighth of an  inch and you know just make sure you run  you know a couple of tests before you  actually carve out the piece  and with that rabbit cut I can take my  top panel and just make sure that it&amp;#39;s  going to fit nicely and it it looks like  it will if I hadn&amp;#39;t cut this exactly  perfectly if I had to err on one side or  the other I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;d rather have this  side panel a little bit longer because  that&amp;#39;ll be a lot easier to sand it down  smooth rather than have to sand the  entire entire top panel so this will fit  in just about like so of course I got to  cut it down the first really critical  cut is the groove now this is going to  make up the lid so in my case I set this  up to where this is the top and I set  the groove down about five eighths of an  inch doesn&amp;#39;t really matter where it goes  this is going to determine the depth of  the top of the box so what you want to  do is when you cut that out and this is  just a test on one end of my work piece  I&amp;#39;m glad I had a little extra room so I  could run these tests but you can see  how I cut both sides just to see if I  could make that bit go half way down and  right there it&amp;#39;s just starting to cut  through so I know I&amp;#39;m at just exactly  the halfway point and that&amp;#39;s going to be  critical to make sure you get a good  tight fit on the top of the box now that  I&amp;#39;ve run my test and I know I&amp;#39;ve got the  bit set up at exactly half of the  thickness of this workpiece and I&amp;#39;ve got  my fence set five eighths of an inch  back it&amp;#39;s just a simple matter of  running it through the bit and just make  sure that the top of your workpiece this  will be the top of the box the lid is  against the fence and you want to make  sure that the groove is on the lower  side so I&amp;#39;m cutting the inside of the  lid  halfway through and the outside will cut  after the sides are assembled  and that gives me the groove that goes  halfway through and now I could do the  other side so to go over that again just  because this is really important I&amp;#39;ve  got both of my work pieces I haven&amp;#39;t cut  them down to size yet I&amp;#39;ve cut a groove  a rabbet on the bottom that will hold  the plywood panel and I&amp;#39;ve cut a rabbet  on the top piece for the top panel the  groove is exactly halfway through the  depth of the work piece and I&amp;#39;ve set  mine down about 5/8 of an inch so this  is going to be the top of the box so now  I can go ahead and start cutting it out  and assembling now I&amp;#39;ve cut all the  sides down to size and it&amp;#39;s square each  side is 3 inches long and I&amp;#39;ve got it  held together with rubber bands right  now that&amp;#39;s the same technique I used on  my picture frame box which is you can  watch the video of that also on youtube  so now it&amp;#39;s just a matter of cutting out  this top piece and of course the bottom  piece to size but I always like to do  the sides first before I do the top and  bottom panels of projects like this  because it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to cut those  down to size rather than try to cut the  sides down to an exact length  now I&amp;#39;ve inched my way down on these  pieces so that the bottom fits and the  top piece will fit in just like so and  I&amp;#39;ve glued everything up and clamped it  together just using rubber bands but I  haven&amp;#39;t glued in these panels I just  used those so I could keep it square  you</text><text start="8.099"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.639" dur="5.361">in this tutorial i&amp;#39;m gonna be teaching  you pastellijos de guayaba  what it is is basically a pastry filled  with guayaba i grew up in puerto rico  and this is a very famous pastry over  there so i&amp;#39;m just gonna teach you guys  how to make it the easy way  for this recipe you will need  cream cheese that is softened  sugar  vanilla  one egg  voila paste corn syrup  and puff pastry  the first thing you want to do is take  your cream cheese and leave it at room  temperature this way is easier to mix  if it&amp;#39;s in the fridge and you forgot you  can put it in the microwave but heat it  at intervals of 15 seconds to make sure  you don&amp;#39;t overheat it  now you can add to the cream cheese  three tablespoons of sugar  you can add one teaspoon of vanilla or  you can scrape the seeds of a vanilla  bean and add them to the mix  if you don&amp;#39;t know how to work with the  vanilla bean i have a tutorial on how to  do that so you can go and check it out  mix well the cream cheese sugar and  vanilla  and once you do that you can place the  mixture on a piping bag  you don&amp;#39;t need a tip for this and i put  it in the piping bag because it&amp;#39;s easier  to place it on the pastry  since i didn&amp;#39;t put a tip in the bag all  you need to do is cut the tip it can be  bigger than this if you want more to  come out and that&amp;#39;s it you start piping  you can also use a ziplock bag if you  don&amp;#39;t have piping bags and just cut a  corner of your ziploc bag  now we&amp;#39;re going to work with the vallava  paste this is from the company goya and  i love it i grew up with it there might  be others that are really good but this  is one of my favorite ones  i cut my slices around two inches long  and one quarter of an inch thick  if you put more than that it might melt  and just sip out of the pastry you will  need one egg  mix it well  you can use some extra power like i&amp;#39;m  using here it looks just like i&amp;#39;m going  a million miles an hour  i am using pepperish farm puff pastry  and this is just the easy way to make  pastelly juice  you can make your own puff pastry it&amp;#39;s a  little bit time consuming not difficult  but just time consuming is layers and  layers of dough and butter and it has to  be done a certain way so you don&amp;#39;t lose  those layers  it is another tutorial and right now i  just want the search so  i just went and bought mine for now  the box comes with two pieces of face  cream you can take one out and cover the  other one and put it back in the fridge  if you want  i am gonna be using squares so i&amp;#39;m  dividing the dough in three cuts  i sometimes follow the lines but  sometimes the lines are not perfect so  just play with it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be  perfect  i stack these three pieces one on top of  each other and don&amp;#39;t press them down  and make sure they&amp;#39;re not too soft  because they will stick together  once i have them stacked i kind of mark  where i want to cut and i just cut with  a pizza wheel or  whatever tool you  prefer today is one of those lacy days i  just want something fast and easy so i  cover my pan with some foil you can use  parchment paper too  place your pastry puffs in the pan  then put a guayaba slice on each square  i am really not trying to go for perfect  squares in here i&amp;#39;m just eyeballing the  whole thing but if you need this to be  nice and perfect for an event you can  use a ruler  is always a good option  now grab that piping bag filled with  cream cheese goodness and just pipe  ton of cream cheese i am putting here is  perfect  one thing you need to know is that cream  cheese when it&amp;#39;s baked it tends to puff  and if you put too much it will come out  so  you have to make sure not to put too  much  the next step would be to just put egg  wash around the corners of your pastry  pot  this will help seal your pastry puff  together so nothing comes out of it so  take a brush  and just go all around it making sure  you get to all the corners  once you put your egg wash everywhere  take another square and place it on top  and press the corners lightly and all  the edges you want to make sure that is  completely sealed so everything stays  inside  now we&amp;#39;re gonna finish this with an egg  wash so take your pastry brush and just  brush egg wash everywhere in your pastry  once i&amp;#39;m done with the egg wash i take  some sugar and just sprinkle it lightly  on top of each pastry make sure not to  overdo it because once it starts going  outside your pastry onto the pan  that sugar will melt and it will  burn your pastry  now that we&amp;#39;re done with this it&amp;#39;s time  for the oven make sure that before you  start your oven is preheated to 400  degrees  bake them until they are golden brown  it can take between 12 to 15 minutes and  this will change from oven to oven  and here they are  beautiful golden pastillages  there&amp;#39;s a few ways you can finish this  you can take some corn syrup and just  drizzle it on top of the pastellio  or use a brush  that&amp;#39;s one way of doing it  the second way is the cuban way  they will take some coarse sugar and  just bake it with the coarse sugar and  that&amp;#39;s it  in puerto rico we like ours with  confectioner&amp;#39;s sugar  powder sugar 10x whichever you want to  call it just sprinkle it on top of your  pastelli  and it&amp;#39;s heaven  i will post the full recipe in my  website so anytime you need it it will  be there  and here they are beautiful delicious  pasta delicious voila  you can make them without the cream  cheese and you can make them in other  flavors so the sky is the limit with  these ones you can do anything i just  like my voila  don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe to the channel  i will post all the links in the box  below to my website

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.38" dur="4.149">normally when you&amp;#39;re shooting a scene  the lights already in the scene so when  there&amp;#39;s no light in the scene you can  put the light in the scene yourself  using a flashlight a torch whatever you  have available go down the bottom clip  here let&amp;#39;s try eight seconds to start  and you can draw out shapes you can  write words literally paint with light  I&amp;#39;m gonna paint with light all the white  points get blurred and move as I move  the camera around I mean it&amp;#39;s still kind  of right but we can get a long exposure  for eight ten fifteen seconds and then  if you pump some light you can freeze  that frame for a bit yeah it gets better  the darker it gets because then you can  set your shutter speed for a longer can  do a lot more tricks you could do like  Harry Potter like magic kind of stuff I  really like the one where we were riding  a bicycle and then I also like the  lightsaber one we set up the camera so  that it would have a thirty second  shutter speed  we had actors and painters so the  painters painted in the light with the  flashlight and at the end it looks like  you were holding lightsabers what&amp;#39;s  great for the kids in the club is that  they get to see the parameters that the  cameras can do and experiment with  different things we&amp;#39;re gonna take some  steel wool light on fire and spin it  real quick and we&amp;#39;ll take images of the  sparks flying out of this deal wool  there but when you look at the final  image you&amp;#39;ll see the entire trajectory  of all the sparks flying away from the  steel wool as well as an entire movement  of the steel  all right that&amp;#39;s pretty fun you have  like sparks flying around and you hit it  near your feet and like explodes I  really like the one from Cal where he  was underneath the shooter looking up  they just propped the camera on the  ground with my flashlight didn&amp;#39;t have  any idea of what I was gonna get it was  exciting to see the silhouette that I  got it was nice seeing other people&amp;#39;s  photos they&amp;#39;ve kinda like influenced  what you wanted to do some people were  up higher and shooting down that&amp;#39;s the  shot where you get the most reflection  from the water you can have a hundred  people take a picture of the same thing  but every picture will come out just a  little bit different that&amp;#39;s what I like  about photography is capturing different  images and as you see it not necessarily  as anybody else does  [Music]</text><text start="5.64" dur="2.909"></text><text start="7.529" dur="2.551"></text><text start="8.549" dur="3.751"></text><text start="10.08" dur="4.26"></text><text

bacon always  bake bacon never put it in a frying pan  it makes a mess of your stove and it&amp;#39;s  uneven heating you&amp;#39;re gonna end up with  pockets of the bacon that are overcooked  and pockets that are undercooked you  bake it you never have to flip it you  take it out when it&amp;#39;s extra crispy and  crumble it then you get bacon bits I use  small potatoes so you don&amp;#39;t have to peel  them duh and then you mash them up I  don&amp;#39;t care any color small potato baby  potatoes cold water cold potatoes bring  that up to a rapid boil then salt the  water potatoes love salt once the  potatoes come to a boil take the lid off  or the pot will you know overflow all  over the stove because of the starch  never salted potatoes until the waters  boiling because the salt will fall to  the bottom of the pot if the water isn&amp;#39;t  boiling it&amp;#39;ll scar the pot itself then  we add in tons of bacon bits I already  have butter salt and pepper in there  bacon bits green onion or chive sour  cream it&amp;#39;s best friend  and some grated Gruyere or cheddar  cheese and then save a little for the  top now if you have an obsession with  bacon as I do make twice the amount of  bacon that I tell you in the recipe  because you&amp;#39;re just going to eat it  while you&amp;#39;re in the kitchen making  meatloaf because it&amp;#39;s bacon and that&amp;#39;s  how that rolls that&amp;#39;s just the way it  works out so now we&amp;#39;re going to mash  that all together  and then we&amp;#39;re gonna slather this all  over the meatloaf and put it back in our  400 degree oven until it turns brown and  bubbly and gorgeous so it&amp;#39;s just like  shepherd&amp;#39;s pie except it&amp;#39;s a loaf yeah  I don&amp;#39;t know why this makes me so happy  but it truly does  so here we go gonna roll like the  Smollett family right here gorgeous look  at that baby oh you&amp;#39;re so beautiful  oh I want to take a class picture of you  don&amp;#39;t you talk to your food at home I  made my dad unusual anyway wouldn&amp;#39;t you  get that slathered around top it with a  little extra cheese why not guys check  this out cheesy everything mashed  potatoes on top of the meatloaf that  kind of has everything in the world and  it  meatloaf for the cheesy potatoes and  then the easiest of side dishes roast  broccolini  [Applause]</text><text start="1.829"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.859" dur="4.27">hello there and welcome to the cargo  today I&amp;#39;ve got a quick video to show you  on how I store my off cuts of ribbon for  my rolls I keep them in my embellishment  center which you can see I&amp;#39;ve done a  separate video on how I store my  embellishments so these are just the the  kind of off cuts that you get you know  that you buy maybe in like two yards or  something like that so I thought I&amp;#39;d  show you how I store them so they are in  these copper hopper boxes these are  called the embellishment boxes and what  they are they&amp;#39;re quite large they&amp;#39;re  probably the same size as a4 sheets of  paper I&amp;#39;ve got two I did actually use to  have three and but I sold some of my  ribbon and I know I&amp;#39;ve just got the two  which is better for me and they have  kind of double-sided so first of all on  the first side here are the how I store  the my actual ribbon so these are in  these boxes so I&amp;#39;ll just take one I&amp;#39;ll  show you these are embellishment boxes  and they are actually kind of made  mainly for like Brad&amp;#39;s or sequins or you  know there&amp;#39;s kind of like small  embellishments but I&amp;#39;ve rolled up the  ribbon and then you can fit it in there  and then you can just kind of pull and  then cut off how much you need and then  a couple of them are just labeled on the  back this happens to be a dusted I fall  ribbon and I&amp;#39;ve just labeled and what  the color is on the back I haven&amp;#39;t  labeled the majority of them  unfortunately I kind of wish now I had  so when you where I bought them from but  I started using this system a long long  time ago I think they don&amp;#39;t know if they  still sell these boxes I know copper  hopper stopped selling a lot of their  stuff but I believe they still sell them  I got them from storage for crafts and  if I can I will link the link in the  description bar and so this one here you  can get two sizes of the box there&amp;#39;s  actually I think you might be able to  get three sizes and 100% sure but I have  the smaller boxes and then I have these  double boxes usually they&amp;#39;re a lot  easier to get out of this but of course  I&amp;#39;m filming so it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard and  these are the double kind of width  they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re like one and a half  of the smaller boxes and then you can  just keep them obviously thicker ribbon  in there so I have this box here I have  all my seam binding which I haven&amp;#39;t used  in a long time unfortunately but I&amp;#39;ve  got it all there and then some of the  thicker I&amp;#39;m stamping up ribbon and some  of the Doodlebug have been as well and  then as you can see I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of  space here that I can grow if I want to  add in more into it and then the other  side it&amp;#39;s kind of just like a one hole  it&amp;#39;s only kind of that deep it&amp;#39;s not  very deep but just to kind of once  section I suppose and I keep the  majority of my twine in here  my Doodlebug twine and it&amp;#39;s on Rails is  in my embellishments storage as well and  all the other kind of twine that you  again you buy in yards or ten yards and  never like that or in these packets I am  put all in here so this is mainly my  mind&amp;#39;s eye ribbon the divine twine and  that you can get from Daiso die for or  from the ribbon girl and then  Stampin Up and twine there as well so  that&amp;#39;s the first one and then the second  one it&amp;#39;s exactly the same concept and  then that&amp;#39;s all the other kind of ribbon  that I&amp;#39;ve got again all in the little  boxes I have them in sort of a color  order which I like here as you can see  I&amp;#39;ve got quite a lot of firm Pink&amp;#39;s and  quite a lot of a firm purples and then  the other side I have my bow easy tool I  keep that in there and then I&amp;#39;ve just  got some other ribbon that I have that I  haven&amp;#39;t put in the reels and so a lot of  it is Doodlebug and I&amp;#39;ve got some my  mind&amp;#39;s eye with some the ribbon girl one  little charm of water there called the  company in the US what&amp;#39;s it called  stamping Bella one stamping Bella one  and then just a couple of you know  sort of a random ribbons there so that&amp;#39;s  how I store all my off cuts of ribbon  and I hope this helps thank you so much  for watching and I&amp;#39;ll see you soon</text><text start="7.179" dur="4.741"></text><text start="9.129"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.29" dur="5.739">hey what&amp;#39;s up guys Tim here again back  with another tutorial so we&amp;#39;re kind of  revisiting the fishtail in this one but  this one&amp;#39;s a little more special and  this is the ridged fishtail  okay so let&amp;#39;s standard fishtail but with  a bit of extra with an extra step we  have this really awesome kind of 3d  Ridge going down the center you can make  a two-tone like I have done here or you  can do it like a single color but  overall the pattern on this one looks  really really nice because you know we  all love the fishtail but having this  sort of extra Ridge to it is really cool  so this pattern is actually a kind of  collaborative effort actually it comes  from Instagram user spelled EE D and 473  and I believe he told me his name was  Tristan he&amp;#39;s all the way from Indonesia  and I saw a picture of his design on  Instagram and asked him hey that&amp;#39;s  really cool you know how did you do it  and he sent me a few images through DM  and I asked him hey is it okay if I do a  tutorial and he said great he was more  than happy to you know share this with  everyone so Tristan thank you man for  sharing that with me so I can do this  tutorial so now before you get started  and before we get into the tutorial  couple a word of warnings when I made  this in the you know following video I  did a couple a couple encounter a couple  of issues so as you can see when you  look at the thickness of this bracelet  it is it isn&amp;#39;t like a standard fishtail  but it when you add this Ridge to it it  adds to the thickness so you might want  to make your bracelet maybe a quarter of  an inch a little more then you normally  wear it just so it fits properly so it&amp;#39;s  not too tight and then also you can see  there&amp;#39;s some gaps in between the  fishtail weave that&amp;#39;s due to the way  this section is added that&amp;#39;s going to  cause the B as your weaving along it&amp;#39;s  going to make these fishtail knots or  weave get kind of packed in really tight  so you might have to undo some of them  so you could potentially do this on a  pre-existing fishtail but you might have  an issue where like you&amp;#39;ll be you  adding this Ridge along and because it&amp;#39;s  spacing out these knots it&amp;#39;s going to  force everything to be compressed down  here and you might have a really hard  time getting those last few on knots in  so you might have to somehow undo a few  of the knots before you can add the  bridge so just a word of warning there  you know it&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s important I think  you guys should watch the whole video  through because I might you know give  you little tips here and there and  rather than you know just skipping ahead  but anyways that all being said I hope  you guys will enjoy this tutorial  it was a bit tough making it but yeah I  think the result is worth it so with  that being said let&amp;#39;s get into the ichi  tour all right guys I got my paracord  set up my jig as usual I&amp;#39;m using the  half-inch buckles and got my double cows  hitch on each side so again if you don&amp;#39;t  know how to do this setup I will always  link that tutorial in the description  down below I&amp;#39;m using red today and now  you don&amp;#39;t have to do a Fortran core I  just like the look of the slightly  thicker fishtail you can do this on a  Tuesday in core fishtail or if you  already have a pre-existing one but I  just thought I&amp;#39;d go through you know the  fishtail again for just to be complete  okay so we&amp;#39;ve got our two working  strands on either side got roughly 10  feet of paracord and yet let&amp;#39;s just do  our standard fishtail so I&amp;#39;m going to  start off with the left strand I&amp;#39;m going  to go through the middle bring  everything through like so take the  right strand through the middle and out  the other side okay so from there maybe  our first two now we&amp;#39;re going to take  the left side and just go back through  the middle and out to the other side so  that was left right left okay alright so  now we can start weaving the fishtail so  remember it&amp;#39;s always the the top strand  if you got the two strands on the right  side it&amp;#39;s the one on top bring it over  and under through the middle like that  right and then back  over and under so you&amp;#39;re always in this  case always bring your strands back to  the right side like that okay push  everything up you want your fish tails  to look really nice between every not  always kind of push up on everything and  keep the strings taut okay you have a  nice looking fish tail so we&amp;#39;ll do that  again over under and over and under  alright nice and simple I know we&amp;#39;ve all  done the fish tail quite a bit on this  channel and anyways we&amp;#39;re going through  it again okay so I&amp;#39;m just going to  continue weaving my fish tail all  throughout and get back to you when we  get to the bottom right so just continue  the pattern go down your length of your  bracelet and then we&amp;#39;ll move on to the  next step  alright so I&amp;#39;ve one down the length of  my bracelet as you can see I&amp;#39;m down to  the end you just have to run out a bit  of space here and I might be a little  bit harder to get these last few knots  in that&amp;#39;s why you want to attach your  FIDs at this point and I&amp;#39;m just going to  go see a bit got this gap here I&amp;#39;m just  going to go through here so and then I&amp;#39;m  going to go through middle again like  that just pull this through there and I  still got a little bit of a space here  so what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll take our last  strand here on the right and I think we  just go through the middle here and that  should be good okay that looks okay  right looks pretty clean so now for  finishing these off then you just snip  and melt them right here because of the  tension in here it should be able to  keep the strands nicely in there  especially if you you know do the usual  snip on meltem and mushroom amount but  I&amp;#39;m going to do I&amp;#39;m just going to clip  my cords about right here I know I have  a bit of excess so I will just the  measurements in the beginning I&amp;#39;m just  going to clip them  right here and make it easier to work  with I just because I&amp;#39;m I want to leave  myself some mom I think it&amp;#39;ll be easier  for this last time is what I&amp;#39;m sake okay  so I&amp;#39;m gonna set my singe snip my cords  right here and we&amp;#39;ll move on to the last  step  okay so now for the ridged step of the  fishtail  I&amp;#39;ve got roughly three and a half feet  of the licorice paracord and I haven&amp;#39;t  done a full line above this yet so I  will have to adjust might have some  excess but we&amp;#39;ll see okay so I&amp;#39;ve got my  trim two chords on this end like I  showed you before got to attach my fid  now I&amp;#39;m going to go through the same  space or opening where these cords are  coming out of come out this end here  okay so now you want to pull majority of  this cord through I&amp;#39;d leave I leave  maybe just a couple inches on this side  and that much okay and now we&amp;#39;re going  to make our way up to this length of our  bracelet now I&amp;#39;m going to go through the  top here so I have a bit of a gap here  so we&amp;#39;ll go through here like so now  this is going to kind of form like a  spine for us to UM and a stitch or weave  this Ridge on - okay so it would look  like this now we&amp;#39;re going to start  essentially wrapping this cord all the  way down the middle okay so this is how  we&amp;#39;re going to do this so let&amp;#39;s see we  can start here so I&amp;#39;m going to look at  the back of my bracelet  and I think I&amp;#39;m going to go right here  so see this knot right here go through  here and help through the middle like  this so if you can picture the two is a  four strand core right so I&amp;#39;ve got two  strands on this side and two strands on  this end I&amp;#39;m going through the the  middle okay so I&amp;#39;m not intersecting  through directly through any of those  cords I&amp;#39;m going in between two on each  side so right through the middle so you  sort of come out this end and your cord  might get a little tangled so just work  with it  there we go so it looks like that now  we&amp;#39;re going to go on to right here it&amp;#39;s  not here  so you want to move in between the knots  so I&amp;#39;m going to go right here and again  I&amp;#39;m going through the middle okay so me  avoiding the two strands on each side  this will be a little bit tricky because  you kind have to feel around and make  sure you don&amp;#39;t pierce the actual chords  in the middle okay so there we got it  see got my two strands right there now  we pull this through again we&amp;#39;ll get  twisted there we go okay so see that&amp;#39;s  the first one so this will be this will  involve a bit bit of time so now we did  one so now see we start on that knot now  let&amp;#39;s go down to the next one right here  and we&amp;#39;re going to come through right  here okay go through there one thing  through that and now we were on this one  earlier now we&amp;#39;ll go to this one and  that&amp;#39;s basically that&amp;#39;s the kind of  pattern here again work your way through  to the back void piercing the strands in  the middle and push and pull everything  through and that&amp;#39;s this is basically the  idea of creating this Ridge down the  middle okay so you&amp;#39;re going to continue  working your way down the bracelet so it  was here and now we&amp;#39;ll go to the next  one one side of the spine there come  through so I&amp;#39;m going to continue this  kind of stitching  to create this Ridge and when we get to  the end I&amp;#39;ll show you how to finish it  off okay okay so I&amp;#39;m midway through my  bracelet and everything is coming in on  coming along nice and okay so I&amp;#39;m midway  down my bracelet everything&amp;#39;s coming  along quite well  now one thing one development that I  wanted to bring to your attention was  that as you can see when you do this  weave it does cause the pair of the  fishtail to be spread out a bit more and  it has a result you can see down here  all my cords are getting packed down  like really tightly and pretty soon it  might be really hard to weave in between  these strands so you know it&amp;#39;s a good  thing I didn&amp;#39;t you know fully snip and  Simms these cords yet so what I&amp;#39;m going  to do is I&amp;#39;m actually just going to undo  a couple of last couple fish tails to  make some space I think if even if I  just do undo like maybe one or two of  them it should be okay so we&amp;#39;re going to  do that real quick be a little tight but  there we go so I&amp;#39;m going to pull out one  on this side and then I&amp;#39;m going to pull  out one on this side so if you&amp;#39;re doing  this on an existing fishtail you might  have this issue but you know try to be  creative and come up with a solution but  see now it&amp;#39;s a little less packed but I  think I can maybe even do two more so  I&amp;#39;m going to undo a couple of these  fishtail knots and that should remedy  the problem okay so just the word of  warning and you know this does happen to  me sometimes because I don&amp;#39;t have time  to do the entire project twice like once  for testing and once for the video  sometimes you know what I&amp;#39;m doing these  tutorials in the video it&amp;#39;s the first  time I&amp;#39;m doing it so that&amp;#39;s why these  things happen anyways so just a word of  warning yeah you might want to undo I&amp;#39;ll  leave a bit of space at the end of your  fishtail okay so I&amp;#39;m going to finish  that up and then yeah we&amp;#39;ll be done  alright so I&amp;#39;m almost done is taken a  lot of time and I actually had to go  back because I ran at a paracord so the  proper amount needed  it&amp;#39;s more like five let&amp;#39;s say maybe four  and a half feet but all that&amp;#39;ll be  annotated earlier of course now near the  end here and actually I&amp;#39;d end up undoing  almost three or four more fishtail  weaves so it did add a considerable  amount of spacing to the knots as you  can see but as you can tell it looks  really nice so that&amp;#39;s good so I&amp;#39;m going  to finish off this last couple knots  where I might here right here okay yeah  we&amp;#39;ll go through here and we&amp;#39;ll do the  last one which is right about here okay  there we go so now all of our cords are  through here and should be easy we&amp;#39;re  just going to clip everything off and  I&amp;#39;m melt at all push it down with our  knurling tool but that you&amp;#39;ve got about  four cords coming through here so you  can clean all that up and then I will be  done all right and there we have it we  are finished okay so we&amp;#39;ve got the ridge  in there clip build a paracord we&amp;#39;ve got  our four strands here that looks ok  press it down with my knurling tool so  it&amp;#39;s nice and smooth it&amp;#39;s not going to  irritate the skin and that is it man  this one really looks really nice I mean  any design that I find has this kind of  I guess dimension to it is really nice  and it&amp;#39;s really just adds a whole nother  level to the East kind of paracord  bracelet so it&amp;#39;s kind of one of the  reasons why the EM the Bane&amp;#39;s cuff looks  really cool because it has that ridge in  the middle so it&amp;#39;s kind of similar to  that but this looks very nice I think  okay so that is it for this tutorial  guys I hope you enjoyed it you found it  useful there&amp;#39;s anything you&amp;#39;re not sure  of you&amp;#39;re not clear of please

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.25" dur="13.74">okay today I&amp;#39;m going to show how to  remove fleas from your cats it&amp;#39;s been  quite a good flea season this year in  Canada  anyways I noticed the fleas have not  been bad at all this year now I try not  to use chemicals on the cats this is my  big cat tiny he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s overweight he is  on a diet  and I&amp;#39;m out of breath because I just had  to chase him down because he does not  like when I try to take plz off of them  so basically I used two ways when the  fleas aren&amp;#39;t bad I simply have a bowl of  water which is just warm water and a  bowl of boiling water which is over here  I have to hold him or he&amp;#39;s going to run  so I&amp;#39;m gonna have to try to get to this  anyways it&amp;#39;s alright dying  so what I do if you&amp;#39;re using the  lukewarm water it&amp;#39;s really important  that you add a little bit of dish soap  because the fleas can jump out of warm  water or even hot water and survive so  if there is dish soap in there it takes  care of matters very quickly and as for  the boiling water that speaks for itself  it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s instant so here we go I&amp;#39;m  going to UM have a check I noticed he  has been scratching it&amp;#39;s alright dying  it&amp;#39;s alright alright now so I&amp;#39;m gonna  try to start and I&amp;#39;m so good at this at  this point that I can recognize eggs and  see I&amp;#39;m dipping the flea comb in the  boiling water at this point because  there is eggs I will give you a close-up  I just caught two fleas off of them so  again this is one of my difficult pets  to do he has sought anxiety issues just  like his owner  okay so again just don&amp;#39;t use a towel and  I&amp;#39;ll try and get some fleas on there for  you to see it&amp;#39;s not right tiny so I  definitely have caught fleas in the  boiling water so I&amp;#39;m gonna have to  really work on him now it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s  really important what type of flea comb  you use also you know there&amp;#39;s some some  really ineffective ones the plastic ones  are no good this one here some other  hair crews off because they&amp;#39;re shedding  that&amp;#39;s no problem  there is fleas I have a plea problem  I&amp;#39;ll try and bring that close up to you  but there is a quite a big flea on on  the fur and I stuck that one in the  boiling water so it&amp;#39;s instant you know  so I can be quicker okay so basically  you just keep on going in and and you  can remove eggs like this and everything  I really show started with my other cat  who actually enjoys having this done  okay I&amp;#39;m gonna let you go right now I  love you and it&amp;#39;s okay baby  I I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to him and if  you can see in the fur  there are fleas  okay again I used this awesome flea comb  okay and after combing the cat you  immediately put it in the boiling water  and that takes care of the fleas and  then you just wipe off the fur I don&amp;#39;t  know if you&amp;#39;ll be able to see in here  but I&amp;#39;ve got about four large fleas in  here so I&amp;#39;m going to go finish him off  and oh one more tip is if it&amp;#39;s a really  bad problem there&amp;#39;s all sorts of  products that you can find in pet stores  and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very cheap you can even  find it in Canadian Tire and you just  take a wee bit of the flea and tick  spray or or you know whatever product it  is to remove fleas and eggs and put a  little bit on your palm try and get the  leave in one and just Pat it on the cat  so that&amp;#39;s how I remove fleas in my  household have a great day and I&amp;#39;m off  to do flea my cats</text><text start="9.17" dur="9.46"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.179" dur="3.391">what&amp;#39;s up guys I&amp;#39;m super excited we are  coming out of winter and getting into  the spring in summer months so we&amp;#39;re  gonna go over the top 10 tips on how to  prepare your car for going through that  process sort of removing all the dirt  and the grime and the salt oh and you  hear that spring is coming the birds are  here this is really exciting this is my  wife Subaru Outback and it has been beat  up all winter because we&amp;#39;ve been driving  it it&amp;#39;s an amazing car but now it&amp;#39;s time  to give it a bit of a facelift that and  a lot more coming up on this episode of  driving protected  [Music]  here after an extremely long and hard  winter of daily driving the Subaru  needed a hardcore cleaning to get back  to a condition for easy regular  maintenance today we&amp;#39;re gonna be going a  bit nuts but I think it&amp;#39;s a healthy  approach at least twice a year once  after winter or in early spring and  another before the winter step one is to  pull out all your tools open up all the  doors of the car and remove any obvious  junk or garbage that will interfere with  your future vacuuming then remove all  the rubber floor mats if you have them  trying not to dump the salt and the dirt  on the carpet in the process  next vacuum the car starting from the  back seat going forward if you should  have four doors this helps you avoid  multiple seat moves back and forth but  either way is fine now what&amp;#39;s the  driver&amp;#39;s section focusing in between the  seat and the center console for hidden  junk and pay special attention to dried  salt stains not caught by the rubberband  to remove dried salt stains click the  link above for a full length video  describing the process with white  distilled vinegar if you have cloth  seats be sure to give them a quick  vacuum before moving to the other side  of the car we will address cleaning the  seat stains in the next step to avoid a  wet but while you&amp;#39;re sitting in the seat  cleaning the center console or the  dashboard with the interior vacuumed  next spray a mold lather on a microfiber  towel and wipe the - to remove the  driving dust likewise  focus on the steering wheel as it tends  to have the most bacteria and germs  compared to any other part of the car  spray the towel again and squeeze the  wheel in back and forth motions with the  towel wrapped around it an interior  brush can also be helpful here to remove  the dust from buttons switches and they  always grosse cup holders next clean  your gas brake clutch and dead pedal  with ammo lather in an interior brush or  just a microfiber towel do not use any  other cleaners or greasy products on  your pedals or winter floor mats  afterwards address any carpet or seat  stains with a mo shag in an interior  scrub pad apply three to four squirts of  shag to the area lightly wipe with the  scrub pad and blot with a microfiber  towel notice the color change slightly  because of the moisture this will  dissipate as it evaporates I prefer to  do the interior first to allow time to  dry while I&amp;#39;m working on the exterior  likewise I scrub the fabric seats  the last part of the interior detail to  avoid sitting on wet seats and possibly  making another stain with my pants  before we can begin addressing the  exterior of the Subaru we need to clean  our tools since they weren&amp;#39;t cleaned  after the last detail notice the  leftover dirt from the last job rinsed  the mint tool and buckets with water to  flush out the remaining dirt to allow  the wheel soap to fight the contaminants  on your wheels and not the leftover junk  in the bucket cleaning your tools not  only minimizes cross contamination but  it actually increases the effectiveness  of your formula and cleaning abilities  with your wheel bucket relatively clean  add ammo brood wheel soap and fill  halfway with water and put it to the  side step one of an exterior detail is  to work the engine first by removing any  leftover sticks or leaves caught up in  the jams now you do this by hand  otherwise it&amp;#39;ll become a muddy mess that  goes all over the windshield and paint  if you decide to do it with water first  then lightly rinse the engine and use  your wheel brush and wheel soap to clean  the jams and the dirty areas of the  engine be sure to cover any sensitive  engine components if necessary for tight  spots the small wheel Willy can also be  helpful then rinse and remove any extra  lights you may be using close the hood  but not all the way don&amp;#39;t dry the engine  at this point either save it until the  end of the wash next I set up my quick  Jack&amp;#39;s in the driveway and lifted the  car to remove the wheels I like to keep  the wheels near the respective size I  just remove them from because I&amp;#39;m gonna  rotate them once they&amp;#39;re clean so don&amp;#39;t  just pile them up on the side and forget  which wheels go where especially if you  have the same sized tires it can be  confusing with all the wheels off  inspect the brakes shocks and rubber  lines for leaks or cracks now I don&amp;#39;t  pretend to be a master mechanic but I  can have the very least know if  something looks weird or leaky and then  discuss it with my mechanic ASAP first  rinse the wheel wells with water to  knock off any heavy dirt then mix brute  &amp;amp; Ammo boost in the power washer  reservoir if you don&amp;#39;t have a power  washer you can also use the ammo aerator  as well now remember to avoid  cross-contamination with the same  aerator use one for soap products and  another for frothy now with the wheel  wells covered in brood and boost scrub  the components with your wheel brush or  real wooly in an effort to remove caked  on road salt secretly besides vacuuming  this is the most satisfying part of any  detail it&amp;#39;s not uncommon to spend 30  minutes listening to  music and endlessly cleaning your  suspension so don&amp;#39;t say I didn&amp;#39;t warn  you repeat the same steps for the other  three wheel wells after the wheel wells  are free of salt and dirt I turn my  focus onto each individual wheel step  one is to apply your wheel cleaner in  this case it&amp;#39;s a more plumb on both the  front and the back of the wheel clean  the front first to allow the back a  minute or two of dwell time as the inner  barrel is usually dirtier than the front  then flip the rim over notice the  intense purple as the embedded iron  fillings are being chewed up I always  use a black foam cushion to avoid  scratching the rim on the ground now I  got this at Home Depot a few years ago  for about $3 is also great for kneeling  in the driveway  then scrub the back of the rim and  thoroughly rinse  you can also clay your rims if they&amp;#39;re  very old or neglected now these are  relatively new so it was a pretty quick  process check out the link above for a  crazy man&amp;#39;s way of cleaning his  disgusting yet beloved brims as a last  step with the tire in wheel I quickly  inspect the rubber for proper depth or  uneven wear screws or nails and to  remove any tiny pebbles stuck in the  tread now this is sort of like popping  pimples it&amp;#39;s oddly satisfying despite it  being very weird  now one down three to go once the wheels  are done and put off to the side I  quickly pre rinse the car then soak the  paint with a 50/50 mixture of ammo foam  and ammo boost to remove the salt from  the seams and the tight areas of the  frame now be forewarned this technique  requires a hose and a lot of product so  doing this technique for your weekly  wash is probably a bit overkill but to  each his own then I used a wand  extension to reach and soak the  undercarriage with foam and boost as  well while boost is working on the salt  fill up your wash buckets with foam and  boost 3/4 full with water after a minute  or two of dwell time rinse the soap and  boost off your paint and start a regular  hand wash with your mitt  however in this case I&amp;#39;m using a 400 GSM  microfiber towel  the truth is I&amp;#39;m testing this new  technique as a safer way to clean or  lift the dirt than traditional wash  mitts I&amp;#39;ll have my results and  conclusions of this technique in the  next few episodes after my final rinse I  decided I needed to quickly clay the top  side or the Horace  all parts of the paint and the driver&amp;#39;s  side of the car because I left it out  under a tree while I was cleaning the r8  inside the garage the other day so I  don&amp;#39;t need to clay the entire car just  the spots I feel require it but use your  judgment on your particular car if it  needs it do it if it doesn&amp;#39;t then don&amp;#39;t  after clay I quickly rinse again in case  any contaminants are lifted but are just  sitting on the surface at that point  next I soak a microfiber towel and dry  the paint without hydrate because we&amp;#39;re  going to be applying a fresh coat of  reflux later normally using hydrate on a  damp towel will help lubricate the paint  during the drying process and leave  behind a protectant but since reflux is  being layered on immediately after this  we avoid using hydrate before the reflux  application once the car is pretty much  dry then open up all doors trunk and  hood I like to dry the engine and hood  jams first with compressed air and an  old microfiber towel that&amp;#39;s not going to  be used on the paint again with the door  jambs I use a 50/50 mixture of boost  winter wash and water in a spray bottle  to clean the lower portions of the door  especially behind the wheels these areas  are notorious for collecting sand and  salt and eventually rusting out spray  the jams and seals then agitate with  your interior brush and wipe with a  microfiber towel this process will leave  behind helpful corrosion inhibitors that  will slow the rate of oxidation if you  have compressed air you can blow your  rubber seals out afterwards as a final  step with the salt gone I add a fresh  coat of ammo mud moisturizing gel to  freshen up the rubber seals squirt some  onto an old microfiber towel and placed  between your fingers while pinching and  sliding along the seal I finish up the  doors with a quick shot of hinge  lubricant now it&amp;#39;s not very pretty which  is annoying to look at but it&amp;#39;s not as  annoying as a squeaky door so I can live  with a mess sort of repeat on all the  other door jams  next I use a momen the plastic wheel  wells because they&amp;#39;re easy to get to  with the wheels off this will brighten  up the plastic and help it repel water  or junk from your wheels if you should  pick some up on your next outing this  process is oddly satisfying as well as  you can tell from my 50/50 shot once I  was ready to put the wheels back on I  rotated them for even wear be sure to  consult your owners manual for this  process before I mount the wheels back  on the car  I add emoji a wheel wax to the inner  barrel to help keep the brake dust from  sticking when I&amp;#39;m cleaning again with  the wheel Wooley next week if you don&amp;#39;t  have July then skin is a great option as  well buff clean and repeat on the face  of the rim when you&amp;#39;re done next and  because I&amp;#39;m completely insane I like to  add a moment to the inside of the rubber  clearly no one&amp;#39;s gonna see it so why  does it matter now I like to keep the  sidewall rubber as moisturized as  possible however I really only do it  when the wheel is off again is there any  scientific proof that this is important  well not that I know of but it certainly  makes me feel a whole lot better to  protect both sides of the rubber when  it&amp;#39;s convenient to do it next remount  the wheels in their new location and be  sure to torque them to your car specific  specifications and repeat on the other  three wheels I also like to double check  my tire pressures as they can fluctuate  as the temperature begins to warm up so  keep an eye on them as the seasons  change finally I add a moment to the  engine to bring back a bit of a deep  collar and to give me that new car  feeling now it&amp;#39;s time to release the  quick jacks and pull your car inside to  work on the paint protection steps if  you have a garage now if you don&amp;#39;t  that&amp;#39;s cool just try to work out of  blistering sunlight or into very windy  environments all right after all that we  pulled the car inside I know you guys  are asking yourself do I have to go  through all those steps no you do not  you don&amp;#39;t have to jack it up you can do  one tire at a time you don&amp;#39;t to do any  tires at a time you can just you know  stick a wheel Willy in there whatever  you&amp;#39;re comfortable with but I wanted to  show you the whole thing that I do on my  wife&amp;#39;s car to keep these things looking  amazing so that&amp;#39;s number one number two  is the car looks pretty good as it is  right now and you&amp;#39;re okay cool we&amp;#39;re  done I&amp;#39;m gonna put more protection on it  in the form of two layers of reflex and  two layers of skin we&amp;#39;ll do that in a  second but I wanted to make the point  the car looks pretty good because we put  this on before winter so put it on  before winter before we got into like  the fight you know the attack of all the  stuff that&amp;#39;s out there and now we&amp;#39;re  doing it as winter is winding down we&amp;#39;re  kind of reinitiating that that  protection re layering that protection  and it&amp;#39;s gonna continue to look good so  a lot of you I get a lot of emails  asking like hey can I put something on  my car and then never have to touch it  again it just doesn&amp;#39;t exist like that I  call it the magic pill syndrome so  you&amp;#39;re gonna have to I don&amp;#39;t care how  great or amazing some sort of you know  layer that you&amp;#39;re gonna pull you have to  maintain just like going to the gym you  to be  mr. universe like Arnold Schwarzenegger  you gotta eat the right food you got to  work out eight hours a day that kind of  thing so just keep in mind there is no  magic potion you can put on here so this  is how I kind of go through that process  if you want your your car to look a  certain way so just keep that all in  mind so the next step is we are now  gonna put a mo reflex on two layers the  first step when applying reflex is to  thoroughly soak or prime the foam so  that it&amp;#39;s smooth on the paint and  doesn&amp;#39;t feel grabby if it does feel  grippy then you need more even coverage  on the phone with reflex apply it in  straight-line motions and allow two to  three minutes for it to cure keep in  mind reflex can be used on black plastic  trim as well now after about three  minutes wipe with a clean microfiber  towel to remove it notice the ridiculous  reflection after just one coat once I  completed the first layer give it about  an hour to cure before adding a second  coat of reflex during that hour of  downtime iowa&amp;#39;s check and clean or  replace both my air filter and my cabin  filters on the car again consult your  owners manual but it&amp;#39;s usually  relatively easy to do in my case the  filter wasn&amp;#39;t that bad so I cleaned out  some of the larger debris and decided to  replace it on my next overhaul in a few  months while I&amp;#39;m waiting for the reflex  to cure after the buff off I focused on  a deep cleaning of the glass using the  three towel method the first towel is my  throwaway towel and I use it to pick up  any heavy grease or junk stuck in the  corners of the glass then I follow up  with my waffle weave glass towel that I  want to avoid getting contaminated after  the first swipe so that&amp;#39;s why that first  towel is so important then I quickly  follow up with a clean or third  microfiber towel to remove any  possibility of streaking from the second  towel yes I get it it takes a bit longer  but it certainly avoids the frustration  of streaky windows on a perfectly  flawless car we&amp;#39;ve all been there when  I&amp;#39;m done I like to add a quick layer of  rain-x to the windows for a bit of  hydrophobic nature as spring approaches  yes there are SuperDuper rain-x type  products out there that will last longer  than your engine in your paint plus  another hundred thousand years but I  don&amp;#39;t like breathing in those fumes it&amp;#39;s  not worth it to me so a safe basic  product here is more than enough for me  after my second coat of reflex I went  inside  had some dinner then came back out and  added two layers of animal skin on top  of the reflux now think of this as your  sacrificial layer or your windbreaker  over your fleece designed to take a  beating and keep you dry so to speak  apply skin as a traditional sealant with  a new foam applicator do not cross  contaminate applicators in any situation  but especially not here now after a few  minutes the skin will cure to a slight  haze as you can see here then remove it  with a microfiber towel as you did  before when you&amp;#39;re done that paint looks  so wet it looks insane keep in mind this  is just basic Subaru paint nothing  special or unique here but it still  looks like it&amp;#39;s vibrating now if you  want this look you have to put in the  time there&amp;#39;s no magic pills or potions  here just a proper process or a regimen  for the very last step I like to change  my oil as part of the spring cleaning  process when I purchased the new car I  negotiated free lifetime oil changes but  some dealers will require you to pay for  rotating the tires changing the oil and  the air filters despite the actual oil  being free so make sure you read the  fine print beforehand to avoid surprises  as always thanks for watching and  subscribe below for more helpful

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="5.58">a mason jar so glass and time did for  cold drinks you can even put snacks in  here you&amp;#39;re getting a set of three with  matching boxes for $19.98 and we have  two easy payments on this so that breaks  down to under $10 and that&amp;#39;s with any  major credit card here are your choices  so you have the red here down below is  the blue and then you have the green and  notice all the boxes match back the caps  match back and this part right here that  is glass and by the way these are 16.9  so almost 17 ounces here why a mason jar  mm well mason was the original jar and  there&amp;#39;s so much to Ball jars mason jars  yeah history and they&amp;#39;re so they&amp;#39;re  really cute but it&amp;#39;s all about the glass  glass just just such a nice thing to put  your beverages and it&amp;#39;s clean it washes  clean is not picking up stains or odors  or anything keeps things nice and fresh  but this is a leak proof totally leak  proof so the top twists on just like  this it has a silicone seal on the  inside that keeps it airtight as well  you can see that right on here and all  you do is put it on the top just like  this okay and now look at this you&amp;#39;ve  got a great opening right here see how  big that opening it is why is that  important well if you want to do  something like put your lemons and your  lives and making your infused water in  there you&amp;#39;ve got enough room for drink  that also enough room if you want to use  a straw this will snap back on the top  it clicks back so that stays back for  you it&amp;#39;s not real lapping on you having  from it remember this is just for cold  beverages you&amp;#39;re not gonna put your hot  coffees and teas in here and then when  you want to seal it to go which is great  for kids in the car you seal it just  like that there you go you know I do  smoothies in my Vitamix and I use the  mason jars like just the normal ones so  then when I have the cover when I take  the cover off it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m a messy  drinker so this is nice because it just  it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a nice flow of your  smoothie of your drink of whatever it is  but as Marie Louise was saying it&amp;#39;s  intended for cold drinks but you know  what being glass you can there we go I&amp;#39;m  showing the pour it will sell if you  don&amp;#39;t close yeah  well no I was trying to show the poor  but um but it being glass you can also  put snacks in yeah it&amp;#39;s great for  portion control that way even little  salads or something oh I love that and I  love that everybody can see in the  refrigerator what&amp;#39;s in there with their  beverage but not at that point - this is  a great way to present it so putting in  your chocolate candies or making your  own spice blend or the little chocolate  kisses in here or we solve so many  popcorn makers I think they are great  echolution popcorn maker you can give  somebody popcorn or wrap sugar candies  or pretzels up here you can see doing  the little cookie jar mixes this makes a  really great vessel for doing that and  then when you&amp;#39;re done you have this to  reuse some of our squirrel brand silver  and gold card I&amp;#39;m gonna steal one of  those because I love ya pretty good  we&amp;#39;re doing your own little hot  chocolate mix I&amp;#39;m here and these are  it&amp;#39;s an easy way to gift those things  you know it&amp;#39;s budget-friendly because  you&amp;#39;re getting a set of three for under  $20 so all you do and they even come  with the gift boxes right so you can bow  and go yeah you can do one of those  ideas that Marie Louise Ludwig just  showed us with little pretzels or  popcorn or whatever and pop it right  into this box or you can just keep it in  the box and add the bow and you&amp;#39;re done  so you only choose do you want the red  do you want the blue or do you want the  green for two easy payments of $9.99  with any major credit card and it&amp;#39;s easy  and you&amp;#39;re right you know glass is just  clean mm-hmm it just looks nice look at  all the things that we&amp;#39;ve done right  down here on the bottom you can put your  milk in there you can put your juice  your juice drink your chocolate milk  your lemonade your cranberry juice all  down here it is so important every time  of year to stay hydrated I mean it just  is and it&amp;#39;s so nice to be able to  perhaps make these beverages up ahead of  time and have them already ready to go  on the refrigerator for the kids on the  go these your protein shakes and  remember it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this simple this I&amp;#39;m  going to take this off this thing I  think so this looks just like a mason  jar one of those the old-fashioned mason  jars I do a lot of canning I make jam I  would make jam in this mason jar this is  the lid right here there&amp;#39;s a silicone  seal which makes it airtight and  watertight and leak proof so you don&amp;#39;t  cure setup right no no I mean you  probably could if you&amp;#39;re really  change the seat delay and you could use  those caning the rings that go on the  top you could actually put those on  there if you wanted to but this is all  about the drink so you open this up on  the top this will click back like this  you&amp;#39;ve got a nice big opening right here  which makes it really easy to drink  you&amp;#39;ve got that little air pocket right  here which gives a great flow ability  also room if you want to put a straw in  and then when it closes up just like  this it becomes leak proof and leak  proof is important if you don&amp;#39;t want  things all over your car I spill the  kids back I still spell now miss Spiller  like it&amp;#39;s because when it has a wide  handle I don&amp;#39;t know I like the flow to  be portion controlled in my drink that&amp;#39;s  why the straws have been invented I&amp;#39;m  not the only one now when we get these  dirty  top rack dishwasher and then I just like  to put this in a little basket on the  side or just rinse these out on here but  look at the chocolate candies you could  put a gift card in there if you want  just use it for is a nice little way to  give a praise you can put like some  paper confetti and hide it would they  wouldn&amp;#39;t even know that then it was in  there you&amp;#39;d have to tell them it&amp;#39;s like  a little scavenger hunt here&amp;#39;s the thing  - you know your colors are the red blue  and green it&amp;#39;s a set of three I know  we&amp;#39;re thinking holidays because  Christmas is two weeks away we have you  know the day of enlightenment just  behind that so I know we&amp;#39;re thinking  holidays but these colors are not just  holiday so if you want to pick up a  couple for you know Easter gifts maybe  have some birthday gifts or some other  kind of gifting things coming up that  would be an easy way to do it and get  you know get started early so here&amp;#39;s the  red set of three here&amp;#39;s the blue set of  three and remind you the boxes match  back and the green set of three for  under $20 item number K for nine five  two and remember you have two easy  payments on this - 150 of these were  ordered I don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;m going to  for sure I love these they&amp;#39;re so pretty  so good squirrel brains is pretty good  all righty well thank you so much for me  believe thanks Kathy  here&amp;#39;s a quick look at our best value of  the day it&amp;#39;s our today&amp;#39;s special value  and available for six easy payments of  $11 and</text><text start="3.449" dur="4.35"></text><text start="5.58" dur="6.87"></text><text start="7.799"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.05" dur="4.42">everyone I&amp;#39;m excited to share with you  the latest collection from Zoya this is  their natural or natural collection and  it&amp;#39;s gotten a lot of hype on the  internet already and I&amp;#39;m just really  excited to share with you it&amp;#39;s a little  different than their usual collection  usually they bring out a lot more shades  there&amp;#39;s some shimmers there&amp;#39;s some pixie  dust sand then there&amp;#39;s some creams this  one is composed of just six beautiful  cream polishes all in the neutral  category so without further ado we&amp;#39;ll  start from darkest to lightest so the  first shade I have to show you is called  these names they&amp;#39;re like all over the  place I want to say it&amp;#39;s normanni its  Norman with an eye at the end so this is  an Armani and I apologize that the  lighting is a little less than excellent  eye it&amp;#39;s a very overcast rainy day and  it doesn&amp;#39;t look like that&amp;#39;s gonna change  anytime soon and I just really wanted to  get this video up and also I should say  before I go any further in that I just  came from a photo shoot so the makeups a  little and the hair is a little crazy  and we were outside taking shots and now  it&amp;#39;s raining and it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m a mess so I  apologize for that let&amp;#39;s just talk about  the nail-polish okay so no money no  money and looks like this on your nail  this one right here like so there we go  and this one is very reminiscent of just  pretty much there&amp;#39;s a lot of them out  there that kind of purple green color  there are quite a few other nail polish  brands that have similar ones but this  one is Zoya and I like it because a  couple of reasons first of all the price  is much better than some of the other  brands also the chemical that it&amp;#39;s free  of the big5 baddies and I just like the  wear on it it wears a lot longer and it  was this is two coats but it went opaque  and no streaks in one the next one which  I happen to have on is called Odette and  she looks like that and she looks like  this and she looks like this and again  that&amp;#39;s two coats no streaking very  opaque even in the first coat these all  these the fur  three are very pink and tone then the  next one is Brigitte I think it&amp;#39;s  Brigitte there it is bridgitte and just  a slightly lighter movi pink then Odette  she so that&amp;#39;s the first three are right  there one two three now for the true  nude neutral so if you&amp;#39;re looking for  mannequin hands these are the shades for  you very interesting and I&amp;#39;m gonna talk  a little bit in a minute after I show  you all of them what I think so as  intended purpose was with this one the  darker of the three is called roux and  there is definitely a pinkish undertone  with this as well on the nail it would  look see it&amp;#39;s almost the same color as  my skin would look like that kind of  reminds me of act an early Paint Pot I  don&amp;#39;t know why there it is so still  still Pink&amp;#39;s in there the next one is  Taylor and I actually had Taylor on for  most of the week and then just changed  my nails for the shoot but this is  Taylor and Taylor looked real I really  liked how Taylor looked on me it&amp;#39;s  that&amp;#39;s how it looked  sorry she&amp;#39;s never using that finger  there we go there&amp;#39;s Taylor it just made  my on my hands in particular where did  it go it made my somewhat fat short  stubby fingers look much longer so I  really like Taylor and then the last one  and the lightest of the bunch is  Chantelle I actually know a Chantelle  there you go it&amp;#39;s very light very nude  and comes out sort of I&amp;#39;d say maybe a  peachy undertone that&amp;#39;s this one right  here now  here&amp;#39;s what I think the appeal is for  this collection for those that work in a  very conservative environment  most of these are put up you know  absolutely appropriate for any kind of  conservative work or school environment  or social situation that you would need  something a little more conservative  like I don&amp;#39;t know a church event a  funeral something like that but what&amp;#39;s  really neat about this is that I think  Zoe is gearing this towards also people  who like to do nail art and if you go on  their website you&amp;#39;ll see some of the  pictures that they have associated with  this new line and I stink at nail art  but you can see here they did I  attempted to do some tone-on-tone  nail art not bad right and so you can  really have some fun with the  tone-on-tone do do a different twist on  a French manicure using those shades now  the other thing I wanted to point out  and what I&amp;#39;m planning on doing actually  that next time I do my nails one of my  favorite shades that soja ever put out  was one of the pixie dust shades called  tomoko which is this beautiful golden  light golden color and it&amp;#39;s beautiful  all on its own but I noticed that when I  layered it over Taylor which was the  warmer of the two nudes that it really  looks you can see the difference there  you can you know let me get rid of my  other swatches I&amp;#39;ve been playing with a  lot of Zoya polishes lately um so there  we go so this is Tomoko  all on its own with nothing underneath  it but put on top of Taylor it warms it  up and it turns it into a totally  different color and I haven&amp;#39;t  experimented with what it would look  like over this shade I&amp;#39;m very curious  but they&amp;#39;re very workable they&amp;#39;re not  just boring neutrals I feel like they  have a lot of life on their own  especially if you layer them and do some  nail art with your nails but so here  they are all together and you know they  are not as dazzling and wowing some of  your summer bright colors but these are  all very wearable shades I think they&amp;#39;re  beautiful for fall winter and spring and  frankly I see a few of these into the  summer time as well if you love nail art  and like mixing up the shades different  shades on the same finger I think this  tone-on-tone trend will continue right  onto your fingernails so give these a  try they&amp;#39;re available in stores and  online at SOI Dexcom now and if you&amp;#39;ve  had a chance to try any or you have your  eye on one let me know thank you so much  for watching and i&amp;#39;ll see in the next  video bye bye</text><text start="2.46" dur="4.439"></text><text

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.199" dur="5.83">hello so this time we&amp;#39;re going to make  some wooden rings yeah I know what  you&amp;#39;re thinking  I already did two videos about how to  make wooden rings but I promise you this  time is different because this time I  want you saw what I&amp;#39;m making the Rings  I&amp;#39;m going to use linear  mmm looks delicious  and now it has to boil for about an hour  okay I had these scripts cooking for  about an hour and now let&amp;#39;s see if I can  curl them around this flashlight without  breaking them  okay now I need to let them dry  completely so now that the meaning is  dry you can see it&amp;#39;s pretty much kept to  shape and it bends very easily without  breaking so now all I have to do is glue  it together in the right size so before  I actually start gluing this together I  will send the ends to a sharp point so  now here&amp;#39;s the fun part  you have to find something that has the  right diameter for a ring in my case I  use a tube of old flashlight and I  wrapped around a little bit of duct tape  so that it has the right size well now  it&amp;#39;s just a matter of adding a good  amount CA glue without actually gluing  yourself together so the super glue  dries very fast so I&amp;#39;ll wait a moment  until the glue sets and then I continue  so I&amp;#39;m pretty happy that I managed to  not glue myself to the ring so now that  we&amp;#39;ve let&amp;#39;s try it we just have to send  it down to its final dimension and I&amp;#39;m  going to use my dis sender but you can  also just use a piece of sandpaper put  it on the table and work your way down  well I&amp;#39;m going to make my life easier by  using the lid but you can easily get by  with just hand sanding  well the sending is done and i standed  it up to 600 and I gave the edges a  slight round over just to make it look a  little bit more pleasant and now I&amp;#39;m  going to finish it with some shellac and  I think I&amp;#39;m going to finish it up on the  lathe because it&amp;#39;s a little bit easier  than doing it like so  on the next string I try something new  at least for me this is some kind of  epoxy putty used in plumbing now I have  to mix this until it has a uniform color  just take some time I cut a small groove  in this ring and now I will drive  through Elena&amp;#39;s body let&amp;#39;s see if this  will work that&amp;#39;s very very sticky  and according to the manual I have a  working time for only 3 minutes ok now  let&amp;#39;s wait</text><text start="3.57" dur="3.18"></text><text start="6.029" dur="2.581"></text><text start="6.75" dur="3.9"></text><text start="8.61" dur="3.81"></text><text start="10.65" dur="4.35"></text><text start="12.42" dur="6.47"></text><text start="15" dur="3.89"></text><text start="64.259" dur="5.801"></text><text start="66.28" dur="8.04"></text><text start="70.06" dur="8.33"></text><text start="74.32" dur="8.549"></text><text start="78.39" dur="7.11"></text><text start="82.869" dur="2.631"></text><text start="106.1" dur="8.29"></text><text start="108.42" dur="9.54"></text><text start="114.39" dur="6.93"></text><text start="117.96" dur="7.89"></text><text start="121.32" dur="11.43"></text><text start="125.85" dur="8.88"></text><text start="132.75" dur="10.08"></text><text start="134.73" dur="9.45"></text><text start="142.83" dur="3.33"></text><text start="144.18" dur="5.34"></text><text start="146.16" dur="6.06"></text><text start="149.52" dur="5.189"></text><text start="152.22" dur="8.22"></text><text start="154.709" dur="7.201"></text><text start="160.44" dur="9.51"></text><text start="161.91" dur="13.53"></text><text start="169.95" dur="7.92"></text><text start="175.44" dur="7.7"></text><text start="177.87" dur="5.27"></text><text start="212.739" dur="11.5"></text><text start="217.28" dur="9.51"></text><text start="224.239" dur="4.771"></text><text start="226.79" dur="4.38"></text><text start="229.01" dur="4.199"></text><text start="231.17" dur="5.659"></text><text start="233.209" dur="3.62"></text><text start="243.51" dur="5.14"></text><text start="246.46" dur="5.39"></text><text start="248.65" dur="3.2"></text><text start="259.34" dur="6.4"></text><text start="262.77" dur="5.64"></text><text start="265.74" dur="5.429"></text><text start="268.41" dur="7.22"></text><text start="271.169" dur="4.461"></text><text start="280.729" dur="5.56"></text><text start="284.37" dur="5.87"></text><text start="286.289" dur="3.951"></text><text start="307.91" dur="5.2"></text><text start="310.98" dur="9.75"></text><text start="313.11" dur="11.27"></text><text start="320.73" dur="7.62"></text><text start="324.38" dur="6.54"></text><text start="328.35" dur="6.3"></text><text start="330.92" dur="8.04"></text><text start="334.65" dur="4.31"></text><text start="341.03" dur="11.409"></text><text start="343.949" dur="10.881"></text><text start="352.439" dur="2.391"></text></transcript>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="4.32">hello everyone so exciting news of the  day is that I am headed to LA next week  for VidCon and number two exciting news  that&amp;#39;s number four but number two  exciting news of the day is that I  actually have my cosmetics bag over here  and I want to take you through  everything that&amp;#39;s inside I&amp;#39;m having  trouble holding this worldwide almost  dropped it holding this right now  because there is so much stuff in here  this is hands-down the best makeup bag  ever for traveling this is the Percy and  Reed cosmetics bag and you are gonna be  shocked at how much is in here it has  these two little handles here and then  you open it up and there are four  different compartments the first section  is this one here and this is the one  that&amp;#39;s actually attached on to the bag  and this is the biggest section as well  in here I have a whole mix of stuff so  I&amp;#39;m gonna just dig stuff out and tell  you what it is a lot of these will be my  favorites so you won&amp;#39;t be surprised  especially by this The Body Shop  chamomile cleansing oil I have a feeling  I&amp;#39;m gonna be pretty jet-lagged so this  will definitely come in handy taking off  my makeup quickly timi SPFs and i are  just one big happy SPF skin protectee  family that was a very long way  attendants we have my even better dark  spot SPF 45 for my face we have my super  defense SPF 24 around my eyes and we  have a little special stick this is  their high protection SPF 35 it&amp;#39;s one of  those kind of roll-up sticks that your  mom used to come like chase you around  the beach like slap it all over your  face woo another SPF now fun fact of the  day is I actually burn like a lobster I  go so red you wouldn&amp;#39;t even recognize me  it is not cute like once I even got so  bad that I couldn&amp;#39;t even wear a bra  because it just hurt so much it has  anyone ever had that one you just like  put on something tighten or like and you  literally can&amp;#39;t move so back to the SPF  bandwagon talking about this is the  Garnier dry miss SPF 50 this is really  similar to the Neutrogena one that I  love you just spray it on some nice fine  mist and there your SPF is done we have  a deodorant this is my Deirdre and this  is just the secret eucalyptus blossom  scent it smells really really nice quite  fresh and it&amp;#39;s not too centi if you know  what I mean I don&amp;#39;t like my deodorants  smelling too much that&amp;#39;s what my perfume  does and  I&amp;#39;m just bringing the salon cos you know  don&amp;#39;t want to sweat speaking of my  perfume I have my mini gem lumpini and  blush suede which I adore and this is  definitely coming along with me haircare  we have two minis of my favorite summer  shampoo and conditioner this is the  bubble and bubble SAFF foam wash and  cream rinse conditioner and not only did  they smell incredible  or I can&amp;#39;t even open it oh there we go  that was attractive yes they smell  incredible that was worth the fight with  the bottle and I just got it on my nose  and then we have another little carry  around this is my obey DTS as I like to  call it dry texturizing spray you know  we&amp;#39;re like on abbreviation basis we go  that far back me and this little guy but  I think he kind of knows I&amp;#39;ve been  cheating on him with the Charles  Worthing 2-1 but this is just a tiny bit  smaller we have a batiste dry shampoo  because that is pretty self-explanatory  I like dry shampoo it helps prolong my  hair I have a little drawing my Muji  stashed I like save all my minis for  when I&amp;#39;m traveling so I have quite a few  minis over here and these are mostly  skincare so I have a cleanser this is  the Sarah Chapman ultimate cleanse it&amp;#39;s  like a nice balmy cleanser then a little  serum guy this is the intense hydrating  booster from Sarah Chapman and those  face oil the taut pure maracuja oil I  haven&amp;#39;t even tried this before so I&amp;#39;m  quite intrigued I could end up with like  a weird face rash in the middle of  VidCon so if you see me and I have a  face rash it could be down to this or  the heat or something else but just  warning you in case say word I have two  little glam glow things in case I get a  spot or a face rash I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m  talking about spots on face rash but  just in case I have my little youth mud  clearing mud treatment and then I also  have their hydrating mask which I am  loving at the moment and I&amp;#39;m saving this  little mini guy for when my skin is  gonna feel very dehydrated after that  12-hour flight buy cream and concealer I  have the fasted Beauty eye duty triple  remedy and I&amp;#39;m bringing this along not  only because I really like it but it  also has a really cool metal tip so it&amp;#39;s  really nice to de-puff those what are  these called my prodding myself bags  there we go got there in the end then I  have my little moisturizer this is the  clowns  de cuenta Queen which I just mentioned  in my recent favorites and I&amp;#39;m almost  out of it so I think I might even finish  it while I&amp;#39;m there but I&amp;#39;m sure I will  be hitting up Sephora so fear not  everyone a little toner face mist I saw  this one from my mom cause she keeps  raving about it this is the vitamin E  face mist and I like that this isn&amp;#39;t a  plastic bottle as opposed to a glass I  love my armor Vita queen of hungriness  but carrying around a big thick heavy  glass bottle isn&amp;#39;t the best when you&amp;#39;re  traveling oh these are really cool these  are the LMS pro-collagen hydrogel masks  that one of those kind of an under-eye  deep puffy soothing things and they&amp;#39;re  really hydrating as well I find my  concealer goes so nicely on top of these  and these come in a big pack I&amp;#39;ve just  taken one for emergencies don&amp;#39;t you just  love us beauty gals like we think an  emergency is having puffy eyes that is  just crazy time the tanning things I  have my sound to pay every day at body  moisture gradual tan I&amp;#39;m gonna fake tan  before I go and then just keep topping  it up with this and if I fancy something  even more I have this wash off one from  soap &amp;amp; Glory which is glow getter and  it&amp;#39;s just like a quick tinted kind of  cream last two random things in that  section I have a body moisturizer from  tip teak and I don&amp;#39;t actually know why  I&amp;#39;m bringing this but this is the aroma  therapy associates bath oil I don&amp;#39;t even  know if there&amp;#39;s gonna be a bath in the  hotel but I thought it might be nice to  use up one of these minis and I&amp;#39;m  sharing a hotel room with este so I&amp;#39;m  sure we will have some boss so I was  just gonna say we were gonna have like  some bath canoodle e bonding no that did  not work did it but I stayed if you want  to borrow this girl holla that almost  got a tad weird and dirty but I think I  tried to save it in the middle section  here we have a bunch of brushes and I  like this one just fell ooh alright and  I like that this clear pocket is clear  because you couldn&amp;#39;t find the brushes  really easily and it means that they  won&amp;#39;t touch all the other stuff and get  all unclean even though I do need to  wash them so on this back side we have  two bags that are detachable and one is  full of makeup and the other one is some  other things so I&amp;#39;m going to go through  the makeup one now these bags open up  really nice and wide as well cuz it  means you can find stuff easily for  primer I have one glowy one and one  to find one I have my Knicks shine  killer to mattify and my Kevin Oh Quan  celestial skin liquid lighting to add a  glow depending on how I&amp;#39;m feeling that  day foundation my L&amp;#39;Oreal True Match  concealer is my NARS creamy radiant  concealer because I can do under my eyes  and any blemishes and redness with these  we have a new powder I&amp;#39;m loving this is  the Shanta kaya poot deli cat in linen  it&amp;#39;s just really nice and lightweight  and I find the more I build this over  the sweat it doesn&amp;#39;t tend to cake up so  I thought it might be a nice one fat la  we&amp;#39;ve got a little handy travel palette  guy over here this is the urban decay  naked flushed palette in streak and I  have my bronzer my highlighter and my  blush in here  I like this cuz the bronzer and the  blush a matte and the highlighter is  nice and shiny  speaking of palettes I have my Too Faced  natural eyes palette and actually saw my  friend Fleur take this to Dallas and  this was the only eyeshadow palette she  used and I think that was a pretty good  choice because you have some mats you  have some shimmers they&amp;#39;re all really  nice and you can do a kind of day look  or an evening look with this palette to  keep my eyeshadow on the benefit stay  don&amp;#39;t stray primer which is incredible  especially if you&amp;#39;ve got veiny eyelids  because the kind of tint in here  balances are all out then I have two  little sweep and go eye crayons this is  the by Terry Umbra black star in number  four and the Charlotte Tilbury color  chameleon in amber haze they&amp;#39;re really  similar but you know that tiny so I&amp;#39;m  bringing to the mascara I wanted to  bring something waterproof fighter even  own a waterproof mascara which is kind  of worrying I need to get on that but  this formula it almost dropped that  there this formula is really really  practically waterproof I mean it never  ever smudges on me and this is the  connect height impact of volume mascara  it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m wearing on my lashes now  pretty much a lot of the time because  this is an awesome mascara apparently I  like to be bronzed because I bring  another palette this is the Charlotte  Tilbury film start bronze &amp;amp; Glow palette  and I just used this in my recent  birthday makeup tutorial which I will  link below so you can go and check that  out if you want to see it in action I  say that like it&amp;#39;s really mysterious  like something magical is gonna happen  when I use it but actually it&amp;#39;s pretty  magical stuff I mean it does give you  cheekbones like whoa the rest of the  stuff in here is actually lip product so  is ready for this a bite lip queen in  the shade mosquito this is just gorgeous  bright bold lip it&amp;#39;s really vivid and  really moisturizing on the lips even  though it is matte why is that I lose  the love shine in the shade of 101 which  is what I&amp;#39;m wearing right now my  favorite sheer red lip duo this is the  lipstick queen and the summer lipstick  in Aloha and the white elk gloss the  left in 206 a couple of lip glosses we  have Tanya burr lip gloss in champagne  toast and the shant kite brilliant gloss  and lucky I&amp;#39;ve been using this lip liner  recently as a lipstick this is the  charlotte tilbury lip cheat lip liner  and pillow talk and I wore this a lot in  my birthday vlog that I did recently  unloads if you guys commented asked them  what it was and it was just this all  over my lips PS thank you so much for  the lovely comments on my birthday vlog  you guys are so sweet I was reading them  through with my mom and were you both  just like beaming cuz you guys are just  so lovely actually if you haven&amp;#39;t seen  that I&amp;#39;ll link that below as well and on  to my last lipstick this is the bodyshop  color crush lipstick and number 15 which  is a beautiful sheer pink this is the  last little pouch this is the B cool  heat resistant pocket pouch and I  thought about carrying my straightness  and stuff in here but I thought I better  off keeping the good stuff in here and  just chucking my straighteners at last  minute - big hair bottles I have my heat  protect styling spray from Elle net and  my it&amp;#39;s a 10 miracle blow-dry of  illuminizer this is to tain the locks  and add some volume and I am walking  these about like some sort of var though  I have my Kent back combing brush which  I used her you know add some volume when  my hair is looking flat as a pancake and  my favorite hairbrush at the moment this  is the wet brush and I think I don&amp;#39;t  wanna speak too soon but I think I  almost prefer this to the tangle teezer  purely because it has a handle I don&amp;#39;t  know why I&amp;#39;m quite old-school I quite  like the whole handle feeling this was  actually sent to me recently it&amp;#39;s the  cutest thing ever this is a wild fox I  mask and it&amp;#39;s so cute or I look kind of  strange but I just want to show you how  cute is that I can&amp;#39;t see you but you can  see me how cute is that okay like it is  so cute then lastly we just have a clip  and a hair tie and this is a very loved  hair tie because I bought it from my  friend Jess and then I never gave it  back because it&amp;#39;s really good and she&amp;#39;s  we watching this and is like why&amp;#39;d he  stop my hair type I bet you

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="14.549" dur="4.351">good day and welcome to Big Bad tack I&amp;#39;m  your instructor Jim Pytel today we&amp;#39;re  gonna have a quick lesson on how to use  a knockout punch a knockout punch is a  handy manual tool used to punch holes in  electrical cabinets these holes can be  used to route conduit carrying  electrical cables or be used to install  push buttons or other input devices for  the purposes of this demonstration I&amp;#39;m  going to be using the Greenlee 723 ESB  slug Buster knockout punch set the  ratcheting wrench this does not  constitute an advertisement or  endorsement of this particular  manufacturer or this particular set keep  in mind other sets and other  manufacturers might have different parts  and procedures as a safety precaution  make sure you&amp;#39;re not punching holes  through enclosures containing or close  to live electrical circuits additionally  once you&amp;#39;ve completed a punch watch out  because the completed punch unit can  fall free from the die side before you  use a knockout punch set make sure  you&amp;#39;re aware of that particular punches  capacity in this case this set can punch  holes through 10 gauge mild steel  additionally lubricate the threads and  cutting edges of your punch before use  this particular set contains a  ratcheting 1 inch box and wrench a 3/8  inch draw stud as well as a larger  three-quarter inch draw stud contains a  1/2 inch conduit punch as well as a 1/2  inch conduit die this is the only  combination in this particular set that  uses a 3/8 inch draw stud all the rest  of them use the 3/4 inch draw stud  stepping up we&amp;#39;ve got a 3/4 inch conduit  punch and die a 1 inch conduit punch and  die one and a quarter inch conduit punch  and die one and a half inch conduit  punch and die finally a 2 inch conduit  punch and die we&amp;#39;re gonna use the 1/2  inch conduit punch and die with a 3/8  inch draw stud as well as the 1 inch  conduit punch and die with a 3/4 inch  draw stud to ultimately make a one-inch  hole through which we can route some USB  cables into an electrical cabinet in  this case the only purpose of the 1/2  inch conduit punch and die is to save  ourselves some time to make a pilot hole  through which we can use a 3/4 inch draw  stud and the 1-inch conduit  and I this allows us to use a smaller  drill bit for the pilot hole in this  case I&amp;#39;m using a regular drill bit  however one could use a pilot step drill  now in a place the half inch conduit die  on the 3/8 inch draw stud I&amp;#39;m gonna  insert the draw stud through the pilot  hole then I&amp;#39;ll thread the punch on the  draw stud with a cutting edge pressed up  against the back of the cabinet now I&amp;#39;ll  go ahead turn the draw stud use them  rapturing a wrench until the material is  punched remember when you&amp;#39;re ratcheting  this the punch could fall free of the  hole now I can disassemble the punch and  drop out the split slugs now I&amp;#39;m going  to go ahead and assemble the one-inch  conduit die onto the 3/4 inch draw stud  and place the punch on the back side  with a cutting edge towards the material  now I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and tighten with a  ratcheting wrench and then the back side  we can actually see the punch  scribing a progressively deeper circle  where the cutting
