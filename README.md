Hi Lucas, hi Triggerhappygandhi (god damn it). I have been working with an .ipynb file for my project, which i uploaded here.
For training, I am using the [Stable Tuner](https://github.com/devilismyfriend/StableTuner) library: this is me giving up
since i broke my ubuntu while trying to install xformers.

I have also uploaded a trained model at [https://huggingface.co/nepyope/stable_giffusion/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/nepyope/stable_giffusion/tree/main). 
This model was trained on approximately 2k image grids, and while it does generate image grids, the output is completely incoherent.

Btw the idea is just to generate image grids from [WebVid10M](https://m-bain.github.io/webvid-dataset/), and train SD to generate those.
